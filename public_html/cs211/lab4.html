<p>Q: What is the CSS box model? <br />
<div>
A box model is the manner in which information is layed out in various html elements. There are four parts to a box model: margin, border, padding, and content.
</div>
</p>



<p>Q:What is the difference between margin and padding?<br />
<div>
A margin creates a space between the outer edge of the browser and the border of the element.
The margin does not have a background color of its own, so it is transparent. 
Padding creates a space between the border and the content, and does have a background color of its own.
This means that the padding background color can differ from the background color of the rest of the page.
</div>
</p>



<p>Q:How is an HTML element height and width determined?<br />
<div>
An HTML element's height and width are determined by adding together the total number of pixels included in the width, height, margin, padding, and border declarations. 
</div>
</p>



<p>Q:How does margin behave when an element is displayed inline vs. block?<br />
<div>
When an element is displayed in block the content occupies the entire available width, and creates a line break after the end of the content.
When an element is displayed inline the content will take up only the necessary width, and has no line break within the content, creating one continuous line of content.
</div>
</p>

<p>Q:What is the difference between a border and an outline?<br />
<div>
A border displays directly outside the padding in the box model, while the outline displays directly outside the border to further highlight the element.
