		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<p>This website is fairly simple, and lacks the bells and whistles one finds on bigger websites.</p>
		<p>This is due to a shortage of knowledge on the side of the student creating it.</p>

     <div class='content'>
        <p>Sometimes I get a blank stare when I talk to people. Generally its not because they don't understand me, 
		but more because they just haven't been listening. So, I guess the difference is not really much of one. 
		How can you understand somebody if you're not listening, right? Yet, I continue to drudge along in the conversation long enough to exhaust my breath, and kill some time.
		Similar to this paragraph the content of my speech often drags on aimlessly searching for a point that it never finds. 
        </p>

		<p>In reading the content of this page hopefully you have gleaned that there is no true content on this page. 
		At least none of great import. Forgive the lapse of insight.
