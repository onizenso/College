	Machine 1:
		Class A CPI: 1cyc/10inst = 0.10 CPI
		Class B CPI: 3cyc/6inst  = 0.50 CPI
		Class C CPI: 5cyc/3inst  = 1.66 CPI
		Class D CPI: 5cyc/2inst  = 2.40 CPI

Average CPI: (0.10 + 0.50 + 1.66 + 2.40)/4.00 = 1.15 CPI

	Machine 2:
		Class A CPI: 2cyc/10inst = 0.20 CPI
		Class B CPI: 2cyc/6inst  = 0.33 CPI
		Class C CPI: 4cyc/3inst  = 1.33 CPI
		Class D CPI: 6cyc/2inst  = 3.00 CPI

Average CPI: (0.20 + 0.33 + 1.33 + 3.00)/4.00 = 1.20 CPI

Machine 1 is 0.05 CPI better on average than Machine 2, given that Machine 2 does not have a faster clock cycle than Machine 1.

	Sun Ultra 40 M2:
		Hardware:
			Processor: AMD Opteron 2222 SE
				4 cores (2 chips, 2 cores/chip)
			CPU MHz: 3000MHz 
			L1 Cache: 64KB I + 64KB D on chip/core; L2 Cache: 1MB on chip/core; L3 Cache: none. 
			Memory:	32 GB (8x4GB, DDR2-667 CL5 ECC Registered SDRAM)
			Disk Subsystem:	SATA, 160 GB, 7200 RPM

	IBM System X 3455:
		Hardware:
			Processor: AMD Opteron 2222 SE
				4 cores (2 chips, 2 cores/chip)
			CPU MHz: 3000MHz 
			L1 Cache: 64KB I + 64KB D on chip/core; L2 Cache: 1MB on chip/core; L3 Cache: none. 
			Memory:	16 GB (8 x 2GB DDR2-5300 ECC)
			Disk Subsystem:	1 x 80 GB SATA, 7200 RPM

	Comparison:
		Base: 
			The Sun Ultra has a higher ratio for each individual test, but took less time to complete the tests. 
			This may be due to the AMD Opteron being able to process INT operations faster through its data-path 
			than the Sun machine, but I am not exactly sure. The systems seem nearly identical, and the Sun actually 
			looks like it should have performed better than IBM (higher memory and hard-drve space). Perhaps the size of
			hard drive slowed down its ability to process quickly?
		Peak:
			The same is true in the Peak cases, the Sun machine ran the tests in less time, but had a higher ratio. Unless the higher
			ratio indicates some higher level of processing capability instead of a higher CPI, the IBM machine appears to be performing
			better than the Sun machine. There is very little description on the Results page for what the Ratio indicates, but 
			intuitively it would seem that the above interpretation would hold true. Please let me know if I am incorrect in this
			assumption.
