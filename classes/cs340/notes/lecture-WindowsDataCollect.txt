.:Windows Live Data Collection:.

Sysinternal tools
Foundstone fport
NTRK
Other Tools
    netcat /nc /ncat
        allows transmission of data for many purposes
        primary use now: get data off of machine being investigated
        server: nc -l -p 2222 > capture file
        client: pslist | nc 192.168.0.22 2222

    cryptcat - encrypts data with 'twofish' crypt algorithm
        encrypted form of netcat

    Cryptographic hashe types:
        md5sum
        sha*sum family - * = 1, 2, 256, 512
            create hash: md5sum <somefile> >> checksums
            check hash: md5sum -c checksums
        can run hash over file, disk, partition, etc.

    Data Collection Tools
        cmd.exe - need trusted copy, version on machine may be corrupted
            need to make sure 'Run..' command has not been corrupted
            if 'Run..' corrupted, live-boot linux, use tools for analysis
            built-in commands
                dir      - List files
                cd       - Change Directory
                time     - Current time
                date            - Current date
                type            - Echo file contents
                ipconfig        - List current network config
                    ipconfig /all - long listing
                    there is an option to dump the list in DNS cache (*lookup)
                netstat         - List network connections
                arp             - List NetBios name cache
                nslookup        - Look up domain name/IP mapping
                doskey /history - History of commands listed (legacy)
                    only for cmd.exe commands
        
        External Tools        
                pwdump3e        - List SAM password database
                ntlast          - Login history
                userdump        - User-mode memory contents
                    need live system, that has not been rebooted

.:Putting Toolkit Together:.
    store on read-only media or write-blocked USB Drive
    don't trust system binaries or libraries
        needs to be stand-alone tools
    checksum all utilities & keep checksum file on read-only media
        do this even on local repository of tools
    wipe toolkit media after investigation & start w/ new copy
        for next investigation
    keep ISO image to speed up creation of toolkit media
        use checksum to verify the ISO image
        check the checksum verifying the ISO checksum before using ISO checksum

.:Operating System Basics:.
    Booting a machine is a multi-step process
        BIOS/EFI -> bootstrap -> 1st stage kernel -> kernel ->
            system tools/binaries -> user tools/binaries
   
        Corrupting the BIOS makes it hard to make forensic copies of the 
        hard disk, because hard-disk BIOS is different from Virtual Machine BIOS
    Even with duplicate, we load system tools, binaries & libraries first
        rootkit - try to hide data, binaries, etc from discovery
            look for inconsistencies in tool output to discover a rootkit
    Live data collection can alter logs, timestamps, etc.
