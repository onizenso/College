    Key: Relevant Evidence
        Can be positive||negative evidence, proving||disproving theory
        If doubtful, trust evidence as relevant
        FRE determines relevance
    Best Evidence Rule & Original Evidence
        Requires "original" evidence be submitted to court
        Defense needs ability to examine evidence levied against defendant
        Document where human-readable content is key, printout is sufficient
        "Genuine Copy" - typically acceptable, preserves critical evidence
            used when the original file may be corrupted during investigation
            maintain both "best evidence" and "working" copy of evidence

Collecting & Handling Evidence
    Document Everything!
        Fill out Evidence Tag thoroughly
    Authentication of Evidence
        Required by FRE 901: must be authenticated to be admissible
        How to Authenticate
            Person who collected evidence testifies in court
            Comprehensive foundation for data derived from evidence
                Accuracy of copies and originals maintained
                Used legitimate methods and tools
                Minimize erroneous corruptions when making copies
    Chain of Custody
        Tamper-proof when stored
        Only allow authorized access
            Log all accesses

    Validating Evidence (Tools to Use)
        Cryptographic Hashes
            chains of different hashes may be used to further validate data
        Digital Signatures
        Backups of Best Evidence & Working Copies
            also created for Evidence Tags to build "paper-trail"
        
    Admissibility of Evidence
        If vidence is solely derived from program/circuit/network,
            it is NOT "hearsay"
        Business records are typically not hearsay 
            (need to records of actual activities)
        Computer stored data may be hearsay if:
            Created by a person
