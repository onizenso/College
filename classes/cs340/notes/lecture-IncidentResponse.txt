.:Incident Response:. 

=Disposing of Evidence===============================================
    When length of time ordered by court elapses, all digital ecidence 
        is securely destroyed.
    Working copies can be securely erased when done or when checking 
        out another copy
======================================================================
    
    What is an incident?
        Can be criminal, civil, or "non-actionable" investigation
    
    Goals of Incident Response
        Gather accurate information
        Protect rights
        Minimize disruption & exposure
        Detect & contain intrusions
    
    Analysis Methodology
        Has to be flexible & adaptive
        Basic steps:
            Initial response
            Develop Strategy
            Conduct detailed investigation
        Techniques:
            Host-based evidence - files, logs, hidden/deleted data, etc.
                Data Types: live & stored data
            Network-based evidence - traffic, IDS reports, router logs, etc.
                traffic collection can be considered a wiretap
           
.:Policy & Procedure - Effects on Investigations in Private Orgs:.
    Acceptable Use Policy (AUPs)
        Terms and conditions for using site/service/etc.
        Defines acceptable/unacceptable uses
        May say what monitoring techniques may be used
        Cannot force someone to forfeit legal rights through AUP
        This is not a contract, but an "agreement" (slightly > verbal agreement)
        Data that AUP can say is gathered:
            Trap-and-trace network traffic used to ensure proper 
                operation of network (e.g. diagnostics)
            Some full-content network traffic
                Some states only require "one-party" consent to gathered 
                    evidence from correspondence
                Where correspondence goes interstate, the state with the 
                    more stringent regulations win the day when deciding 
                    admissibility 
    Employee/Employer Policies
        What data can Employer gather?
        Legal precidence centers around employer-owned equipment & 
            reasonable expectation of privacy (REP)
        Some cases of REP:
            logging into Gmail on work computer
            viewing https:// site, content of that site is to remain private
        If equipment belongs to Employer and no REP: content is searchable
        Otherwise: content searchability is questionable
