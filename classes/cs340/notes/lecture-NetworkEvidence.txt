.:Collecting Network-based Evidence:.

Networking Basics
    TCP, UDP, IP Headers
        Layers 4, 4, 3 respectively
    Ethernet/WiFi Headers
        Layer 2
    Application headers may also be present

    Can capture just specific headers or all headers
        "trap-and-trace" capture
            wont get specifics of conversations, but will get source/dest info
        "full content" capture
            Captures while:
                There are packets to capture
                Up to X bytes of packet ("snaplen" option in Wireshark)

    Common tools are based on PCAP library
        tcpdump - command line
        Wireshark - GUI 
            By default captures the entire packet
            Snaplen option allows restriction of size of captured packets
            Go through documentation to enable user to enter
                "Promiscuous Mode" for packet capture
            Could also do capturing with tcpdump, and analyze with
                Wireshark as normal user

        Using Tcpdump to Create Capture File
            tcpdump -w <capture file> -i eth0 -s 1548
                -s gives size of packets to capture
                     1500 bytes is max-size, plus size of headers/footers
            
        Can also filter the packets captured with both tools
            Usually based off of header information
            Interactive mode: tcpdump -i eth0 -n -s 1548 -XX port 53
                -XX extended printout
                filter by port 53 (DNS port)
                will go more into filter syntax in Packet Capture Lab

        Packet capturing is a passive tool when name lookups disabled
        
    Port Scanning
        Actively seek information about machine or network
            Probe system & see response
            Different TCP/IP protocol stacks respond differently
                to "fingerprinting" scans
            Also allows inventory of listening network servers
        Falls into the Information Gathering phase of investigation
        Common tool: nmap
            Tests nmap supports
                List listening ports
                OS fingerprinting
                MAC addresses & reverse DNS
                Systems w/ ecidence of being on but w/ no active ports
                Traceroute to discovered systems
                Look up documentation online for more supported tests
            Has a scripting language available for user customization
            Supports many addressing methods for "target" machines
                Ex: domain name                 www.google.com
                    domain w/ subnet            google.com/24
                    IP address                  127.0.0.1
                    IP address w/ subnet        127.0.0.1/24
                    IP address w/ range         127.0.0.0-128
                        any part of the IP address can be a range
            Specify test(s) to run on target in command line
                vmnet1 - bridged mode :::: vmnet8 - NAT mode
            
    Vulnerability Scanner
        Variation of port scanner
        Looks for know vulnerabilities on system
        Can be host-based (more information) or network based
        Used by SysAdmins as part of Cost-Benefit analysis b4 system hardening
        Probes are typically separated into "safe" and "unsafe" probes
            Safe probes usually don't cause system glitches (gives less info)
            Unsafe scans give more info, but could cause substantial damagei

    Network Monitoring Tools
        Used to monitor various aspects of network
            Data usage, watching for attack attempts, etc.
            Network SysAdmins use a wide range of tools for monitoring
        Charting Tools: MRTG & RRDtool
            Builds graphical representation of information fed to the tool
        Network Usage: ntop & variants (look for one on Android)
        Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS)
            has database of know network attacks using signatures/heuristics
            Alerts on packets that appear to be attack (IDS)
            Attempts to prevent a detected attack (IDS)
            Can be configured to run in stealth mode on some LAN protocols
                Protocol needs a physical or logical read-only mode
                Needs to be configured to never send packets over LAN
                Can use "monitoring port" available on certain switches
                Only for IDS (IPS actually needs to transmit)
