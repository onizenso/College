.: Lab4 Announcements :.

Is there any way that we could set up a test VM on our own machine that meets 
the specs required for the assignment?
    Bring in a 16-32GB thumb drive to copy the VM. Will be able to work at home
        with this.

.:Commands:.
    Looking up command help: man <command>
    
    fdisk -l <device>
        list the partition information
 
    netstat -antp
        -a     all
        -n     numeric value only
        -t     TCP/IP ports
        -p     Process id for each port (root only)

    ps -ef || ps aux
        -ef    is non-POSIX for "list all processes"
        aux    is POSIX for "list all processes"

    ls fd && ls of
        fd     prints out currently(blue)/previously(red) used files
        of     prints association between file descriptor and file name

    crontab    shows scheduled processes
        crontab -l              list crontab for current user
        crontab -l -u <user>    list crontab for <user>

.:Log Files:.
    /var/log/   (...duh)
    
    .::Common Log Files:
        auth log    debug     dmesg    faillog
        messages    syslog    ~temp

    Configuration file: /etc/syslog.conf *~sometimes in its own sysctl.d directory

    .::Common Config Files::.
        passwd    shadow      groups         shell
        hosts     services    resolv.conf    fstab
        inittab

    .::Proc Filesystem::.
        Special filesystem to display current kernel/process data
        Always has a subdirectory for each running process
            cmdline
            fd/ & net/ subdirs are important and FUN
        Kernel Info:
            kmem || kcare
            Config Info:
                cpuinfo
                crypto
                filesystems
                sys/ subdirectory    

    Compare with output from 'ps' command to search for discrepancies in running processes

    .::Sys Filesystem::.
        Linked to by /proc/sys (links to subdir of /sys)
        Running configuration
            Interferes w/ kernel & BIOS
