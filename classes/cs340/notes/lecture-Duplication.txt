.: Duplication :.

.:Current Standards:.
    .::Serial ATA (SATA) Family::.
        SATA 1 (1.5Gbps) <::> SATA 2 (3.0Gbps) <::> SATA 3 (6.0Gbps)
        Original ATA standards are paralel (PATA)
        One drive per cable w/ SATA
        Same connector used for all standards
            "L shape" to prevent improper connections
            also eSATA connector w. slightly different connections
                -only used on enclosure
    
    .::Serial Attached SCSI(SAS) family::.
        Like SATA, a point-to-point serial standard
        Connectors are compatible with SATA connectors (can connect SATA drive)
            Drops down to being like two SATA drives, lose SAS-specific features
            SFF 8482 connectors (compatible)
            Can create a non-SATA coompatible backplane
                mini-SAS connector
                high density connector
        Uses SCSI commands when in SAS mode
        Standards
            SAS 1.0 (1.5Gbps) <::> SAS 1.1 (3Gbps) <::> SAS 2 (6Gbps)

.:Linux Device Names:.
     IDE/ATA drives: 
         /dev/hda <::> /dev/hdb <::> /dev/hdc
         Partitions: 
             /dev/hda1 <::> /dev/hda2 <::> etc.
     SATA/SAS/USB drives: 
         /dev/sda <::> /dev/sdb
     IDE/SCSI CD-ROM drives:
         /dev/sr0 <::> /dev/sr1 <::> /dev/sg0 <::> /dev/sg1

.:Wipe Magnetic Drives Clean:.
    need clean media before making a duplicate
        (oldInfo + newInfo) == contamination
    Minimum:
        Zero out the disk w/ Null bits
        More thorough measures would be needed for real investigation
