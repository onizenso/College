Topic: Legal Foundations and Professional Ethics

Focus of course is on techniques to recover digital evidence
    Legal investigation: evidence handling procedures
    Professional investigation: determining cause/extent of compromise, fraud, 
        info leak, etc.
    Evidence is not always direct, IRL != CSI or NCIS
        its a lot easier to cover a digital trail than a physical one

Legal Foundations
    Constitution
        4th Ammendment: probable cause for legal investigations
            Investigations performed by government/law enforcement

        Expert Testimony: Daubert Test
            Judge is "gatekeeper", has final say over admissibility
            Testimony must be relevant & reliable (determined by Judge)
            Admissible if derived from sound scientific methodology
                1) Uses empirical testing
                       -falsifiable
                       -refutable
                       -reproducible
                2) Subject to peer review
                3) Known or potential error rate
                4) Has standards & controls
                       -ability to calibrate tools based on known data
                       -ability to test for reliability and accuracy 
                5) Technique accepted by relevant scientific community
        Daubert Trilogy in Rule 702 of FRE
            1) Testimony based on sufficient facts/data
            2) Testimony is product of reliable principles & methods
            3) Witness has applied principle & methods reliably

Professional Investigation
    Do NOT violate the law in the process
        Not even if ordered to by the boss
        If it belongs to employer, is OK
        If it belongs to an employee, NOT OK
    Consultants: get a lawyer!
        have them draw up contracts for pen-tests
        include scope, collateral damage protection, etc.
    Can investigate resources the company owns
    Keep a strong code of ethics and a lawyer on retainer
