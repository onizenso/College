.:Windows Analysis:.

Sources for Enumeration
    Log files/databases
    Registry File
    Swap file
    Data from Live Collection
    Data from drive analysis
    Application specific data
    User-specific data

Log Files on Windows
    Event Log is stored in several locations, but also has a GUI
        often will look at log file instead of using GUI
    Go through Control Panel -> System Administration Tools -> 
        Logging/Audit Settings
    Look for what is set to be logged, and for any missing information that is 
        missing but should be there
    Storage location for files:
        %systemroot%\System32\config\
             |_.->replace with system installation location (C:\Windows\)
             Look where Environmental Variables are stored to check 
                 for manipulation
        Files:
            SecEvent.evt (security Win7)            Security Events
            AppEvent.evt (software Win7)            App Events
            SysEvent.evt (system Win7)              System Events

        Log files for specific applications do not have unified storage locale
            one location: %SystemRoot%\System32\LogFiles
            no unified format for application specific log files

Registry File(s)
    Primary method of configuring system & applications
    Can also stor data for applications and/or system processes
    Binary file(s), only human-readable with interpreter
    Can be split across multiple files
    Can store data like key pairs, and application variables
    Primary storage is a key:data pair
        registry key has a specific naming structure/hierarchy
            Common "roots" for key:
                HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE(HKLM) - configs for local machine
                HKEY_USERS
                HKEY_CURRENT_USERS
                HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
                {WinNT only} HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
            A list of all active hives can be found at 
                 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\hivelist
            User specific file: NtUser.dat in each user folder

    Tools to query registry:
        look at lab from Windows Live Collection
        regexport <hive name> (look up man page for this tool)

    HKLM on NT-based systems contains:
        SAM, SECURITY, SYSTEM, SOFTWARE

    HKEY_USERS contains:
        DEFAULT from system-wide file
        Subkeys for each user from the user file

    File locations:
        System-wide (NT-based)
            %SystemRoot%\System32\Config
        User-specific:
            NTuser.dat in user's folder

Windows Swap File - pagefile.sys
    Normally hidden, but can be accessed with switches to
        commands (e.g. dir /ah)
    Defaults to unencrypted
        there are options to encrypt the pagefile
    Contains copy of memory pages that are swapped to disk
        could have useful info like the data for a file,
            password typed into browser, browser history, etc.
    Look into methods for secure deletion of pagefile on shutdown
    Possible to disable the pagefile entirely: proceed with caution

User-Specific Information
    Already covered registry file for users
    Each user is given a folder (location varies slightly by version)
        There is also a Default (or all users) folder
        Stores documents, settings, caches, etc.
    Caches have useful info
        obvious: 
            cookies, web page history, etc.
        less obvious: 
            recently accessed files, recently accessed removable drives, etc.
        look here for evidence of crime here, or the absence of cache files
    Application user-specific data is also stored here
        There are tools to read browser cache & config data
 
Printer Spool Files
    deleted when job completes, but just regular deletion
        contains all the info sent to printer for print job
        **if can recover spool file, can recover document being printed
    collect any hard drives from printers/copiers, 
        images from files may be stored here

Application-Specific Data
    On 64-bit systems there are two folders: Program Files & Program Files(x86)
    Contains binaries, libraries & system-wide config files
    Look for:
        Apps that shouldn't be there
        Apps that have been altered (including libraries)
        Configs that have been changed
            Especially pay attention to services changed for more permissiveness

Password Info
    Depending on version, may be trivial to recover passwords for 
        users on system
    Many tools available to crack these databases:
