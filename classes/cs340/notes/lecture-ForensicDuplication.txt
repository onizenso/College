.:Forensic Duplication:.

Admissibility
    FRE allows GENUINE duplicates (rule 1003)
        particularly when true original is hard to produce
    GENUINE != original all the time
        Goal: bit by bit copy of media
            Issues: Bad sectors on physical media
                    Drives that remap physical blocks (e.g. SSD's)
                    What will duplication tool do when it encounters bad blocks
        Types of Duplicates
           Forensic Duplicate (closest to binary copy)
               Try to copy every bit from source
               Use placeholder to mark bad reads
               Tools: dd-based
           Qualified Forensic Duplicate
               Similar to forensic duplicate
               May format-shift the results
                   In-band hashes of sectors read
                   Empty sector compression
               Format-shifted image must be able to recreate the original
               Tools: enCase, SafeBack
           Tools must meet requirement of Daubert Test
               Methods must be sound, reproducible, and accepted

Creating Image
    Use appropriate tool for type of investigation
    Document the Geometry of Magnetic Disks
        Sectors, Cylinders, & Heads determine boundaries of partitions
        Restoring to Physical Media
            May need to alter partition table if geometry differs
        Using Virtual Image
            May need geometry to correctly access partitions
    Document the Partition Table
    Use tool to create image (do NOT modify original media)
    Verify that image is correct
        For dd-based, involves checksums of original drive vs. created image
            Account for bad reads
        enCase can do this automatically
    Store image properly
        Essentially is the "best evidence" & should be handled as such

Creating Working Copies (Restored images)
    Can restore to physical media or use in a virtual environment
        physical media - potential disk geometry issues
        virtual environment - need true copy of image file
    Destination media should be wiped first
    Physical Media Restore
        Duplicate's hash may not match original's hash due to geometry diff.
    Virtual Environment
        Both dd & enCase created images can be used for 
            many virtual environment tools

Tools
    DD based tools
        dd has many options to control its behavior (man dd)
    Basic Options:
        if=<device>       "input file", source device/file
        of=<device>       "output file", destination device/file
        bs=<number>       "block size", unit of data to use
        count=<number>    number of blocks for operation
        skip=<number>     how many blocks to skip over at start
        conv=<options>    comma-separated list of conversion options
              notrunc     do not truncate data
              noerror     continue after read errors

    DD Shell Script
        #!/bin/sh
        count=1
        while(dd if=/dev/sda of=image.${count}.dd \
              bs=2048k count=1 skip=$(($count-1)) \
              conv=noerror,notrunc);
        do count=$(($count + 1)); done
