.:File Analysis Tools & Password Databases:.

Tools
    The Coroner's Toolkit
        "granddaddy" of many disk analysis tools
        Meant primarily for Unix/Linux systems
        Programs:
            grave-robber         gather inode info (allocated||unallocated)
            unrm & lazerus       undelete files(if block info still available)
                                 recover RAM, free space, swap space, etc.
            mactime              search files based on Modified, Accessed and
                                     Created times. Lists all matches
        Had to run on disk device, not image files
            (unless using loopback device on Linux or VMware)

    The Sleuthkit TSK & Autopsy
        Based on TCT - Autopsy is GUI to toolkit
        Works on Windows & Unix/Linux
        Works with many data sources
            disk devices
            dd images
            EnCase images
            etc.
        Common programs used from TSK
            ils         list file metadeta entries ("inode ls" from Linux)
            icat        dump data(file) from specified file entry ("inode cat")
               above tools don't work on ext3/4 filesystems, inodes are wiped
            
            fls         list allocated & unallocated filenames
            fsstat      filesystem statistical information
            disk-stat   (Linux, mb others) hidden (unallocated) disk space
            ffind       search for filenames
            mactime     same as from TCT
            blkls(dls)  list (un)allocated data blocks 
                            (only tool that works for ext3/4)

    debugfs (Linux)
        List inode information
        mostly useful for ext2
        Launches into built-in debugfs shell
            similar to shell from gdb
        Built-in Commands
            lsdel                   list deleted files (also work w/ ext3/4)
            dump <inode><file>      restore given inode to filename
                dump 15 oops.txt
            mi <inode>              modify given inode
            imap <inode>            list blockss associated w/ inode
    
    WinHex & hexdump
        WinHex can open image files & perform file recovery for several
            filesystems
        Any hex tool allows one to look at raw data
        hexdump is a command-line hex tool

    Commercial Toolkits (EnCase, Forensic Toolkit, etc.)
        Support file recovery operations
        Have scripts for running automatic analysis
        

Can use WinHex or another hex tool to look for opening file tags to narrow down the breadth of search

Can run Strings against regular doc file to see the original text and changed
text if the user performed a quick save, or did not complete a full save. Does 
not work against docx files because of file compression

Lab Next Week:
    Use Sleuthkit, WinHex & hexdump to investigate image files
    To prep for later labs, we'll also use Linux loopback devices & 
        VMware to add to filesystem   

.:Password Databases:.
    Many different ways to store user information
        details will be covered in the Windows & Linux analysis chapters
    How to store passwords
        Plaintext - horrible, still performed in some organizations
            -very rare at OS level, sometimes happens w/ applications/websites
        Reversible Encryption - slightly better, but still not good
        One-way Encryption(hashing) - depends on algorithm used
            look up password-specific hashing algorithms

    Password Cracking
        Usually referring to brute force attack
            might also be protocol attack
        Trying to find a match to hash in database
