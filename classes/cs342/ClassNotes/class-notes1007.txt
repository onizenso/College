Data specifications - handed down from the Data Analyzers and Database Administrators to the programmer to implement the database

Server side developer creates database, 

Front-end developer builds the user interface for the server-side programs and data

Middle-tier workers are invovled in large and complex organizations. Serves as an intermediary between server-side programmers and front-end developers.

How to convert ER entity type into Relation
  Divide the entity into a structure, flatten all composite attributes
  
  Multiple value attributes must split into a separate relation, 
    include the primary key from the initial relation
    use the primary key from new relation as foreign key in original relation

  Convert relationship into relation
    Directly build relation from a relationship
      relation contains primary key from the entities, relationship attributes
      
    If one-to-one relationship: 
      1. use one of the entity's primary keys as a foreign key in the other entity
      2. merge the two entities together if the relationship has total participation on both sides
      3. set up a third relation that contains the primary keys of the entities

    If one-to-many relationship:
      use the primary key from the entity on the one side of the relationship
        as a foreign key in the entities on the many side of the relationship
    

    For weak entities, add an artificial primary key to impart uniqueness
  
Include alternate possibilities and why one alternative was chosen over the others
Unions that include entities with duplicate primary keys, can append an identifying substring to identify the type
