Statistics
  Bernoulli Trial: 
    test with a binary outcome
    p = prob of success
    q = prob of failure, q = 1 - p
    n = number of trials

Binomial Distribution
  a series of n bernoulli trials w/ k success
  P(k|n) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)
  (n choose k) = n! / [ k! * (n - k)! ]

  Expected number of successes E(x)
    E(x) = p * n
    E(x) = floor(10 * 0.95) = 9
