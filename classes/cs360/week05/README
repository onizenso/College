The POSIX threads (pthreads) standard is not always implemented the same
across Unix platforms. Most Unix OSs also have their own version
of threads. To see which version of threads is in the Linux kernel on
sleipnir:
 
    $ getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION
    NPTL 2.7

 NPTL (Native POSIX Threads Library)
 This is the modern Pthreads implementation. By comparison with LinuxThreads,  
 NPTL provides closer conformance to the requirements of the POSIX.1 
 specification and better performance when creating large numbers of threads.
 NPTL is available since glibc 2.3.2, and requires features that are present 
 in the Linux 2.6 kernel.
