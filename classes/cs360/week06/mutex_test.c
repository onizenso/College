   introduction to pthread mutex primitives

   Mutex objects are intended to serve as a low-level primitive from which
   other  thread  synchronization  functions  can  be  built. As such, the
   implementation of mutexes should be as efficient as possible, and  this
   has ramifications on the features available at the interface. 

   int n; flag = 1;
   n = (flag) ? 10 : 20; # C semantics for ternary conditional operator '?':
   meaning: if flag is T then n is assigned value 10 otherwise value 20.
