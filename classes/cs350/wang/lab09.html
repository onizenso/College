<h3>PART I. Functions as Parameters in Python</h3>

 Python was voted Programming Language of the Year in 2007 and 2010 by
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBLE software Index</a> and is currently the 4th
  most widely used language in the world. 
 Python is a multi-paradigm language - object-oriented, functional, 
 and procedural. This lab demonstrates one of 
 Python's most unique features -- the ability to treat functions 
 like first class objects.
  To demonstrate this, you will solve several problems by
 passing functions as parameters.
Before beginning, review some basics of Python in this <a href="./Code/Python/test.py">test.py</a>. If you have time, you may want to run through the 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html">Python Tutorial</a>.
<p>
 Python is a scripting language. Like lisp, you can also execute
 commands within the interpreter by just typing python.  See the
 <a href="./Code/Python/readme">readme</a> for instructions on how to
 execute a script. 
 Your job is to add two Python functions to 
 this <a href="./lab09.py">lab09.py python program</a> that accesses
 <a href="./lab09.data">lab09.data data file.</a> The specifications for 
 the functions are 
 included in the file. Copy the file and data file from here:<pre>

  /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/lab09.py 
  /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/lab09.data
</pre>
Note: there is no error checking on input for the data file. For example,
 a blank line will crash the script. You can assume good input.
 Note: if you know what you are doing, you
 only need to add ten or so lines of code to the file.


<h3>PART II. Coroutines in Python </h3>
<p>
<b>Background on Coroutines.</b>
  The communication between the caller and the callee in *normal*
  subroutines occurs twice: once when the caller hands off control to the
  subroutine (jump) and once again when the subroutine hands control back 
 to the caller (resume). The only place to enter a subroutine is at the
 top and the only place to exit it at the bottom. 
 Coroutines, on the other hand, have multiple points of 
 entry and exit. Communication between the caller and the callee 
 can therefore occur often; e.g., the caller hands off control to the
 callee, the callee yields control back to the caller, the caller hands 
 control back again, and so on and so forth. 
 In this fashion coroutines involve interleaved execution.
 Why do coroutines?
 Coroutines are less expensive
  than multiple function calls - the stack frame for the caller and the callee
 is loaded only once at setup.   Coroutines also mimic the behavior of
 a special set problems in computer science.
 
 <p>
 Coroutines are supported in Python 2.5. To hand off control call yield.
 To resume control call  next() or send(). Each time 
 next() or send() is called, the coroutine resumes 
 where it left off in the caller.
<p>
Your job is to <a href="./Code/Python/coroutines.py">download this Python program</a> and modify it. This code uses Python lists. If the syntax is not intuitive,
 read the documentation on Python lists <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-list.htm">here.</a> Make these changes to coroutines.py:
<ol>
<li> In the existing program, the main function (everything in the script
 that is not in a subroutine is in the main function) 
  is acting as the initiating coroutine and the Scheduler is the partner
 coroutine with main. Convert
 the code so that there are two coroutines - one is the initiator and the
 other is the partner (the Scheduler). Start the initiating coroutine
 from main. 
<p>
<li> Modify the Scheduler so that every time a dog is walked it is
  removed from the list.
<p>
<li> Add a method to the Scheduler to walk two dogs at a time -
 and then remove the two dogs once they have been walked. 
 Hint: pass the dog pair in this request as a tuple so you don't need
 to modify all other requests: <pre>
            p.send(("walktwo",("fido","rusty")))
  </pre>
</ol> 

<h3>PART III. Concurrent Programming in Ada </h3>

 <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming/Tasking">Ada Programming Wikibook</a><br>
<a href="http://www.adaic.org/whyada/intro5.html">concurrent programming in Ada</a><br>
 
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">Ada</a> is the 20th most widely used language worldwide (it was 25th last year) 
 and may be the best 
 choice for reliable software - <a href="http://conferences.telecom-bretagne.eu/rst2009/program/tutorial_details/">14th International Conference on Reliable software Technologies</a>. Since Ada was developed for embedded systems,
 concurrent programming is built-in to the language.
 Ada's built-in concurrency and safety critical support features 
 make it a first choice for mission critical applications.
 The fly-by-wire system software in the Boeing 777 was written in Ada. 
 </p>
 <p>
 Unlike coroutines, concurrent programming (threads) 
 involve "simultaneous" execution. Simultaneous is 
 quoted because, although at the programmer level you can think of the threads
 as executing simultaneously, in reality, on a 
 non-threaded single processor machine this is not the case. The single
 processor is jumping back from thread to thread: 
<pre>
             - - -
           /       \
      >---- - - - - ----->>
 </pre>
 On multi-processor or on a threaded machine it really is simultaneous: <pre>
           ---
          /   \
     >-------------->>
</pre>
 For the typical application, you don't
 need to worry about  what the processor is doing.
 Your job is to write a threaded algorithm only.
 Start by downloading 
  <a href="./Code/Ada/lab09.adb">this Ada program</a>. You
 job is modify it. 
 This Ada program is an example of concurrent programming using
 Ada tasks. Tasks are similar to coroutines in that you have multiple
 entry and exit points. But in addition to this, a task represents a separate
 thread of control that can proceed  independently and concurrently
 between the points of interaction with the other tasks. 
 Refer to the documentation on <a href="">Ada Tasks and Synchronization</a>
 as you work on this part of the lab. Make the following changes to lab09.adb:
<p>
 <b>Task #1.</b> Add a data structure to the program to hold the
 names of the dogs. Each time you add a dog, its name is added to the 
 structure. The structure can be as simple as an array of Strings.
  Caveat - due to strong constraint-checking, data types are never 
 simple in Ada.  You must do the following:
 <pre>
    type Names is array(1..25) of String(1..5);   -- array for dog names
    subtype names_index is Integer range 1..25;   -- the index into dog array
    my_names : Names;

 </pre>
 And later, if you assign a value to the array from a literal, the literal
 MUST be of length 5. 
 <pre>
    my_names(names_index) := "Tiger";
 </pre>

 <p>
 <b>Task #2.</b> Add parameters to the message passing that
 occurs in between main program and the Kennel task.  Message passing
 is at two entry points : dropoffDog and pickupDog. An example of
 adding parameters to messages is here:
<pre>
TASK worker IS
     ENTRY run (repeat : IN Integer; length : IN Integer);  
END  worker;

TASK BODY worker IS
     ..
     ACCEPT run (repeat : IN Integer; length : IN Integer) DO
         save_repeat := repeat;
         save_length := length;
     END run;
     ..
END  worker; 
</pre>
 Add two IN parameters to dropoffDog. One is  a boolean. If this
 parameter is true the dog is not a biter and safe to insert into the kennel. 
 If the dog is a biter then do not insert the dog.
 The second parameter is a string containing the name of the dog.
 If you insert the dog you need to add the dog's name to the String array. 
 Each time you display the Kennel, display the name of the dogs.
