Chapter 14.5 - 14.6  Introduction to Event Handling

An event is created by an external action such as a user interaction 
through a GUI ( much of Windows programming is event-driven )

The event handler is a segment of code called in response to an event

User interactions with GUI components create events that can be caught by 
event handlers, called event listeners

An event generator tells a listener of an event by sending a message 
An interface is used to make event-handling methods conform to a standard 
protocol

A class that implements a listener must implement an interface for the listener
