						    there are 12 uncountable bytes.

	fun2_p_x           140735137163948      16  There are 16-4 bytes uncountable btw par and locals.

	fun2_l_y           140735137163964      32  There are 12 uncountable bytes btw calls.


	fun1_p_r           140735137163996      12  There 8 uncountable bytes betwee pars and locals

	fun1_l_t           140735137164008      4
	fun1_l_s           140735137164012      32  There are 12 uncountable bytes between 2 ARIs

	main_l_p           140735137164044      0



    It looks like:

       1. Between two ARIs, there are 12 byte uncountable which are used for some other purpuses,
          with 8 bytes counted for dynamic link and return addresses.
	   
       2. Between  parameters and local variables of the same function, there are variable number of
          bytes uncountables.

       3. In another example, the non-fixed dynamic arrays are allocated last (on the top), and fixed
          stack-dynamic array are allowed along with scalar local variables.
