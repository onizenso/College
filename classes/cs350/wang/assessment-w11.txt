  Core Areas on
  Major Field Exam
  Prog. Fundamentals                 3 

  The Learning Outcomes for areas 3a, 3e, 3i and 3m are from the 2008 Interim 
  Revision of the ACM 2001 Curriculum Report for Programming Fundamentals(PF) 
  and Programming Languages(PL) in accordance with CAC/ABET standards. 
  Category AL covers 31 of the 290 core hours in the recommended curriculum.
  
  The ACM guidelines with weighted factors shown as core hours and the
  assessment method for each learning outcome are detailed below. Assessment 
  results are shown as:
  E - Exceeds CAC/ABET expectations 
  M - Meets CAC/ABET expectations
  C - Conditionally meets expectations (some improvements would be welcome)
  F - Fails to meet CAC/ABET expectations
