 Java code is compiled into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode">byte code</a> not *machine code*.
 Byte code is portable--it is not machine code but it is somewhere between
 source and machine code.
 Bytecode is executed by the Java virtual machine on the particular
 machine. Java, unlike C++, is not a procedural language
 but is completely object-oriented. That means that no procedure (function)
 can exist outside a class. Exception handling (unlike C++) is built-in to the 
 language. That means that exceptions will be thrown without you
 explicitly coding exception handling in. Finally, (unlike C/C++) there are
 no pointers in Java. 
<h3>Step 1.</h3>


 If you are on a machine other than sleipnir,
 follow the instructions in 
 <a href="./Code/Java/readme.txt">this readme file</a> to set
  your environment for the correct version of Java. To run your
 first Java program, copy two
 files 
 into your lab03 directory:
<pre>
   $ cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/Java/Test.java .
   $ cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/Java/FormatWriteFileApp.java .
</pre>
 Follow the instructions in the readme file above
 to compile and execute the Test class. Do the same with the FormatWriteFileApp
 class. Everything you need to know to
 complete this lab is somewhere
 in Test.java and FormatWriteFileApp.java. 

 
<h3>Program I.</h3>

Once you know you can compile and execute the Test class, you can begin
 working on the CoinToss class. This class will use an existing Coin class
 and a CoinGame class.
You are going to add a Java class  to
 simulate a series of coin tosses. 
 Copy the Coin and the CoinGame class files into your directory. 
<pre>
      cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/Java/Coin.java .
      cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/Java/CoinGame.java .
</pre>
 Compile and execute the code. Because the CoinGame class includes the
 Coin class, compiling the CoinGame class into byte code will 
 compile the Coin class as well. A sample session is provided below.
<pre>
bash-2.03$ javac CoinGame.java
bash-2.03$ java CoinGame
Coin 1: Heads   Coin 2: Tails
Coin 1: Tails   Coin 2: Heads
Coin 1: Heads   Coin 2: Tails
Coin 1: Tails   Coin 2: Tails
Coin 1: Heads   Coin 2: Tails
Coin 1: Heads   Coin 2: Heads
Coin 1: Tails   Coin 2: Heads
Coin 1: Tails   Coin 2: Heads
And the Winner is:
Coin #2.
</pre>
Next, create a new class named  CoinToss that uses Coin to 
simulate a series of random tosses. 
This class is a simplified version of the
 CoinGame class, so you can start by modifying CoinGame.java. 
 In particular, you must keep the format of a main function
 embedded in the outer class.

 Read the number of times to toss the coin
 from the command line. If the user doesn't enter a command line argument,
 prompt the user for the number of times to toss the coin. 
 Your game will display the face of the coin after each toss,
 and the totals at the end. You do not need to make any changes to
 the Coin class. 
 Since Java control structures 
 <b>(if, for, while, etc.)</b> are identical to C, you will
 be able to write lots of code without looking at any Java
 documentation. However, I/O and keywords pertaining to classes
 are not similar. Look at the Test.java file (which
 you also copied over) for sample code to read from stdin and write 
 to stdout. For I/O you must include this line at the top of your file:<pre>
     import java.io.*;     
</pre> 
For more thorough documentation, 
the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/j3TOC.html">Java Language Specification</a> provides a complete listing
 of the Java language.
 Sample output of the completed assignment is shown below:
<pre>
bash-2.03$ javac CoinToss.java
bash-2.03$ java CoinToss 10
Heads
Tails
Heads
Tails
Tails
Tails
Tails
Heads
Tails
Heads
The number of tosses: 10
The number of heads: 4
The number of tails: 6
</pre>
<h3>Program II.</h3>
 Create a Compute class that will 
 read in <a href="./lab03.txt">this data</a> from an external file, display the data and compute the mean for each column to
 the screen. Exclude 0 entries from the computation. <i>You can assume that
 you will have 4 columns in your input file.</i>
  See Test.java (you should have copied it in Step 1) 
  for  
 the syntax necessary to set up a buffered input stream from an external file. 
 <p>
 Once you get your array of lines, how do you parse the line into 
 individual values? In Test.java look for how the 'split' method
 is used. Split parses a line according to a regular expression into
 an array of Strings. Then you can process the String objects
  as you walk through
  the array. For example, this splits the line
  by one or more whitespace characters:<pre>
     String[] line_values = line.split("\\s+");
    </pre>
 </p>
 <p>
 Sample output:
<pre>

        Exam1   Exam2   Exam3   Final
        =====   =====   =====   =====
        62      78      94      80
        54      72      74      72
        64      66      50      64
        60      78      66      72
        72      70      72      84
        66      76      84      80
        96      86      80      96
        62      64      70      56
        96      92      78      84
        100     74      0       78
        80      72      56      74
        74      82      78      94
        90      82      80      78
        78      90      92      92
        60      66      60      74
        82      96      92      96
        54      56      68      56
        =====   ======  ======  ======
Mean:   73      76      74      78
</pre>

 Once you have successfully achieved the steps above, add code to write
 the output to a file (in addition to the screen). Name the
 file outputFile.txt or something similar. Try to format the output
 into columns as  shown above.  See FormatWriteFileApp.java (you copied it
 in Step 1) for help.
