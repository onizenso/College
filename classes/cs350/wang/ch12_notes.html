<h2>Support for Object Oriented Programming in Java</h2></center>
<p>
 This
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Java_to_C_Plus_Plus">Wiki</a> has a good overview of the major differences between Java and C++.
<p>
<h3>General Characteristics</h3>

<li>All structured data types (including arrays) must be objects 
<li>the primitive scalar types (int, float, double) may or may not be 
 explicitly instantiated as objects
<li>In Java 5.0+, all primitive types are implicitly coerced into 
wrapper classes for use in predefined container classes
<li>All objects are heap-dynamic, referenced through reference variables, and most allocated with new
<li>No explicit delete - garbage collection is automatic
<li>A finalize method is implicitly called before garbage collector (similar to
 C++'s destructor)
<li>Does not support operator overloading, pointers or goto ; C++ does
<li>minimal compilation unit is a class ; in C++ it is a file
<li>In Java, all parameters are passed by value; C++ supports pass-by-reference and pass-by-value

<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<li>Single inheritance supported only, but there is an abstract class 
category that provides some of the benefits of multiple inheritance (interface)

<li>An interface can include only method declarations and 
named constants, e.g., <pre>
	public interface Comparable {
		     public int comparedTo (Object b);
	}
</pre>
Methods can be final (similar to C++ const)

<h3>Dynamic Binding in Java</h3>

<li>All messages are dynamically bound to methods unless the method is final 
(if method cannot be overriden dynamic binding serves no purpose)

<li>Static binding is also used if the method is static or private (both of which disallow overriding)

<li>Several varieties of nested classes
<li>All can be hidden from all classes in their package, except for the nesting class
<li>Nested classes can be anonymous
<li>A local nested class is defined in a method of its nesting class
<li>No access specifier is used

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<li>Design decisions to support OOP are similar to C++
<li>No support for procedural programming - C++  supports procedures outside classes
<li>No parentless classes
<li>Dynamic binding is used as normal way to bind method calls to method definitions
<li>Uses interfaces to provide a simple form of support for multiple inheritance

<center><h2>Support for OOP in C#</h2></center>

<h3>General characteristics</h3>

<li>Support for OOP similar to Java
<li>Includes both classes and structs
<li>Classes are similar to Java's classes
 
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<li>Uses the syntax of C++ for defining classes
<li>A method inherited from parent class can be replaced in the derived class by marking its definition with new
<li>The parent class version can still be called explicitly with the 
<pre>
       prefix base: base.Draw() </pre>
<h3>Dynamic binding</h3>
<li>To allow dynamic binding of method calls to methods,
The base class method is marked virtual
<li>The corresponding methods in derived classes are marked override
<li>Abstract methods are marked abstract and must be implemented in all subclasses
<li>All C# classes are ultimately derived from a single root class, Object

<h3>Nested Classes</h3>
<li>A C# class that is directly nested in a nesting class behaves like a Java static nested class
<li>C# does not support nested classes that behave like the non-static classes of Java

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<li>C# is the most recently designed C-based object-oriented language
<lI>The differences between C#'s and Java's support for OOP are relatively
 minor
