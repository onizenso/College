 The source code supplied in this lab compiles under
  GNU g++ version 4.1.2 or above
 under Linux on sleipnir. If you use another machine, you should verify 
 the version of GNU g++:<pre>
        $ g++ --version 
</pre>
<p>
 In this lab you will learn how to  prevent   unrecoverable/fatal
 errors at runtime. Under Unix, fatal errors will result in a core dump. Under
 Windows you get the blue screen of death.
 As a programmer, your job is to prevent this from ever occuring
 by adding some form of
  error/exception handling mechanism to trap all critical errors.
 Critical errors include divide by zero, attempting to
 access memory beyond the bounds of an array or dereferencing a null or
 dangling pointer.
 Primitive error handling can be as  simple as displaying a message to 
 standard error (stderr, cerr), standard out (stdout, cout)
 or to a log file. You then choose whether to continue or abort
   the program. Most modern object-oriented languages are taking the 
  approach that error handling should be built-in to the language.  
 Built-in exception handling features provide a standardized and
  much more sophisticated method of handling errors.
  <p>
 C++ has built-in error handling called exception classes. C++ also 
  supports user-defined exception classes.
 In this lab you will modify a user-defined exception handling class
 called RangeError.
 The class is designed to return out-of-range errors in a list template class.
   The code is <a href="./lab01_files">here</a> on sleipnir. 
 Login to sleipnir. You should copy (not copy and paste) the 
 files into your directory with this
 command: 
<pre>
     cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/lab01_files/*  . &larr; this is a dot
</pre>
Description of the files.<p>
<ol>
<li>range_error.h - This file contains the class definition and 
 methods for the RangeError exception class. There are only
 three methods: the constructor, what(), and an overloaded output operator. 
 A RangeError object data holds 
  the source filename of the offending code, the 
 line number in which the error occurs, and the 
 faulty index value. The filename and the line number are 
 grabbed from two compiler environmental variables: __FILE__ and
 __LINE__ (two underscores prepend and end the variables)
 when the RangeError object is instantiated.
<p>
 <li>list.h  - This file is a template class for an array based list. 
 The first several methods in
 this class provide examples of constructing and tossing a RangeError 
 object.
<p>
<li>main.cpp - In main.cpp, a list object is instantiated. There is a single try block
for error handling with a catch for RangeError objects and a generic
 catch block.
<p>
<li>Makefile - This Makefile will create an executable called 'main'. Simply
type 'make' at the command line. <i>You do not need to modify the Makefile.</i>
</ol>
<p>
To understand C++'s exception handing
 facilities,  you must know the program flow
  of try, catch, and throw. In particular, the code that is executed and the 
 code that is skipped within and without try and catch blocks. You should be
 able to answer these questions after completing
 this  lab. 
<p>
<b>Task 1.</b><br>
Your first task is to add a fourth parameter to the RangeError class 
 that will display the name of the function in which the error was 
 found. This information is available in the 
  environment variable called __func__ (note: earlier versions of
 g++ called this  __FUNCTION__). 
 To support this, you will need to  modify two files:
  range_error.h and list.h.  
 In range_error.h you must change the class definition, the overloaded
 output operator and the RangeError constructor
 to handle a fourth parameter (it is a string similar to filename). In
 list.h you need to modify
 all instances of the code in which a RangeError is instantiated to
  grab and pass the value of __func__.
<p>

<b>Task 2.</b><br>
 Your second task is to trap all range out-of-bound errors in the List class
  by enclosing any code that accesses the array into a try block.
 The first several methods are completed for you - use these as examples.
 You need to code the last two.
 <i>You will need to check for the appropriate
 range error condition in these two additional methods.</i> 
 When an exception (out-of-bounds error) is raised, throw a 
 RangeError object.
 Catch any exception in the function in which it occurs. 
 Throw the exception back to main. 
<p>
<b>Task 3.</b><br>
 There is only one try block in the original main.cpp. This means that 
 the first
 error condition that is found will be passed to the catch block and
 none of the other code will be executed. Generally you want more
 granularity in your error handling. Modify main.cpp to contain
 at least three try and catch blocks.  
 Look at main.cpp in this <a href="./Code/C++/Example">program</a> for an 
 example for how to write multiple try blocks.
<p>
<b>Optional Task 4.</b><br>
 If you found the above tasks easy, add 
  the ability to accept command-line 
   input to your program (this is probably new
   to you.) Frequently, rather than prompting the user for 
 input, you want to grab input from the command line; i.e., the
 command you use to execute the program. In subsequent labs you
  will use this often with scripts to send arguments to commands.
 Add the ability to read the name of an output file that you will open
 to log error messages from stderr. 
 For example, this command will send error messages
 to err.log:<pre>
     lab01 err.log
</pre> 
Refer to <a href="./Code/C++/fileio.cpp">this sample program</a> for
 help with command line arguments and external file IO.

<b>What To Submit For This Lab</b></span><p>
 Compile your code. Redirect your output to a file; i.e.,<pre>
   
    $ ./main > lab01.out

</pre>Attach the 
 outfile and email it to donna@cs.csub.edu.
 This is a *sample* output file. Yours will most likely look different.
