 PHP is a server-side scripting language for web programming. Server-side
 means that the script is executed by the web server not the client's browser.
 PHP specifically targets programming tasks one is
 likely to do in a web environment. The basic syntax is
 a blend of C and Perl. One  difference between Perl and PHP (both
 use dynamic typing) is that all variables in PHP, including hashes and
 arrays, are prefaced with '$'. PHP is fully object-oriented after PHP 5,
 but you probably don't want to try these features until you are
 comfortable with simple procedural syntax. Copy the 
 sample php files from <pre>
   /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/PHP/*
</pre>
 into a test directory under your public_html
 so you can study the syntax without objects. You should
 also  read <a href="http://www.cs.csub.edu/~donna/cs350/Code/PHP/readme.txt">this </a> before starting.

<h3>PART I</h3> 

You need two files in your public_html directory tree
  on sleipnir:<pre>

      /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/PHP/form.php 
      /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/PHP/form.html 
</pre>
Note: if you want to combine your HTML form and your php script into
 one file, look at the exampled here:<pre>
      /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/PHP/combined.php 
</pre>
 This lab assumes you will use two files.
Test form.html by clicking on the file from a browser. 


 The form.php server-side script provides an interface between data the 
 user enters into form.html on the client and a process running
 on the server that grabs the form data (the PHP engine) and passes
 that data to a script. The big 
 advantages to server-side scripts is that 1) everything on the server
 can be hidden/secured from the client's web browser and 2) you have 
 full access to files on the web server within the bounds of
 your file permissions on the server. 
<p> 
When you hit the Submit Form button, whatever action you specify in
the form tag is called. If the action begins with javascript;
 e.g., javascript:test(), the
 browser looks for the function test() within the scope of the 
 client document. If, on the other hand,,
 the action does not begin with javascript, the browser assumes 
 the action is for a script on the server. Example:<pre>
    &lt;form method="post" action="form.php">
</pre>
In the example above, the PHP script 'form.php' is executed on the
 server.  How does the transfer of data occur? Notice 
 the method="post" form attribute.
The client browser dumps all the form 
 data in a $_POST associative array and passes it back to the server
 for access by the PHP script. The $_POST form elements are
 accessed in the array by a key, which is the element's name in the HTML DOM; 
 e.g.:<pre> HTML tag: 
       &lt;input type="text" name="name" id="name">

   PHP variable:
       $name = $_POST['name'];
</pre>
 Communication back to the client browser occurs 
 in a new browser page.
<p> 
Make sure everything is working in the sample scripts.  How do you test/debug
 PHP? You can test your script for syntax from the
 command line <pre>
   $ php form.php
</pre>
 PHP will give you several warnings of this type that you can ignore: <pre> 
   PHP Notice:  Undefined index:  entree in /export/home5/users/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/PHP/form.php on line 14
</pre>
This is normal if you run the script without entering data into the form first.
 Any other errors need to be fixed. 
<p>
<B>Specific Requirements:</b><p>
<ol>
<li>Your first task is to add a new label and form element 
 (the checkbox) to your form:
<pre>
&lt;label for="preference"> Select all preferences that apply :&lt;/label>

&lt;input type = "checkbox" name = "pref1"> vegetarian
&lt;input type = "checkbox" name = "pref2"> vegan
&lt;input type = "checkbox" name = "pref3"> fish
&lt;input type = "checkbox" name = "pref4"> low-fat<br>
</pre>
(Note: you can also put your preferences into an array by using
 pref[] as the name.) 
 Display the checked items in the web page along with everything else. 
From form.php you can access a checkbox form element as follows: 
$pref1=$_POST['pref1'];
 <p>
The HTML checkbox form element will only hold the value 'on' if the
user checked the box. It is then your job to determine what value that
 'on' refers to.
<p> 
<li> Your next task is to open an external file
 and write the entire contents of $_POST to
 that file. 
 First copy this PHP script into your directory: <pre>
   $cp  /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/PHP/test_cmdln.php .

</pre>
 Test_cmdln.php provides
  an example of file I/O. To write to a file in your directory from 
 a PHP script (or any server-side script for that matter) 
 you have to create the file first and give the file 777 permissions. 
<p>

You can get everything but arrays within arrays with this 
command: <pre>
   // use for each to get ALL elements in array
  foreach($_POST as $key => $value)
  {
     printf("%s = %s&lt;br>", $key, $value);
  }
</pre>
<p>
A few things to note: <br>
o The data in the select box is in an array. The 
 elements in that array are concatenated into a string called 'ctypes.'
<p>
o One way to write the information to a file is
 to  construct a string while you
 are parsing the $_POST array: <pre>
   $str = $name;
   $str .= $room." ";  // the '.' operator concatenates strings
   $str .=  // so on and so forth
</pre>
 You can then write $str to the output file.
<p>
<li> Finally, close the output file for writing and
  open it again for reading. Write the contents of the output file to the
 screen. Add a few HTML tags so that the
 format looks nice.  
</ol>

<h3>PART II</h3> 

 In this section you will learn one more of the web specific features
 of PHP -- parsing an XML file. XML is a standard
 for representing text on the Internet. XML looks like HTML, with some
 important exceptions. The tag names are specific to whatever data
 is in the file -- you make them up to match the file. 
 XML is hierarchial and requires a single upper-level tag
 in the file. Every opening tag must have a closing tag. In XML there
 is a distinction between attribute data and element data. In the
 XML element below, the attribute is the string "id number" and the
 data is 1234.<pre>
    &lt;data name="id number">
          1234
    &lt;/data>
 </pre>
Once
 you have a file that matches these quidelines, PHP has a built-in parser
 that will grab the data in the file. You just need to manipulate the
 data based on the structure of the XML file.
<p>  
 You will start with some working PHP code and an XML file. The
 parser does
  <a href="./parser.php">this.</a> The
 parser functions in the sample code makes use of global variables
 to it easier to code. If you are familiar with PHP's object oriented
  capabilities and wish to do so, make a parser class and put the
 global variables inside a class. Otherwise, copy the code from here 
 into your public_html directory on sleipnir:
<pre>
  $cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/parser.php .

  $cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/data.xml  .

</pre>
<p>
<B>Specific Requirements:</b><p>

<ol>
<li> Your fist task is to add an event handler to the parser that
  grabs the character data within XML tags. 
 In data.xml, the character data holds the inventory count of 
 each item. 
 The startElement and endElement event handlers are already
 coded for you. Follow the example in these handlers to
 code the character data handler. 
 The syntax to create a handler is: <pre> 
 xml_set_character_data_handler($xml_parser, "XML_characterData");

 The function prototype for the handler is:
 function XML_characterData($parser, $data)
 {
  // $data holds the character data 
  // add this to the $inventory array for each element.

 }
</pre>
 

<li> Next, write a function report() that reads $inventory and
 generates output as shown 
 below (this is just a sample).  Refer to the 
<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/printf">printf man page</a>
for help in formatting the output.
