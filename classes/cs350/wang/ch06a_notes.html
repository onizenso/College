<h3> CMPS 350 Ch. 6 Data Types</h3>
<!-- <font face="Courier" style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 400"> -->
<a href="./ch06_faq.txt">FAQ</a>
<p>
The richness of the data types in a language largely determines 
 language style and usefulness
<pre>
<b> Primitive Data Types</b>

   A "descriptor" for a data type (int, float, double, etc.) determines
   the range and kind of values, the size of storage, and allowable operations
   <a href="http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V40F_HTML/AQTLTBTE/DOCU_030.HTM">(see ANSI C data types)</a>)

   All languages have a set of primitive data types; e.g.  built-in and not 
   defined in terms of other data types

   Primitive data types of most imperative languages: integer, float, character,array 
   Some primitive data types are merely reflections of the hardware 
   Others require some non-hardware support

   The size of a data type is platform dependent in C/C++ but not in Java
   <a href="./Code/C++/limits.h">see C's /usr/include/limits.h </a> 

   <u>Integer</u>
   Almost always an exact reflection of hardware so mapping is trivial <a href="./Code/C/bits.c">C example</a> 
   There may be as many as 8 different integer types in a language (e.g. GNU C)
   Java's signed integer sizes: byte, short, int, long (no unsigned int)
   Negative integers primarily stored in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement">two's-complement </a>
   
   <u>Floating Point</u>
   Approximates real numbers as floating point w/ fraction and exponent
   Usually two floating-point types - float and double- sometimes more
   Most common standard: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985">IEEE Floating-Point Standard 754</a>

      sign  exponent     fraction
     -----|------------|----------------  = 32 bits (single-precision)
     1 bit  8 bits       23 bits       
     ------------------------------------ 
     31                                 0
  
      sign  exponent     fraction
     -----|------------|---------------- =  64 bits (double-precision)
     1 bit  11 bits       52 bits    

    Rounding problem: <a href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341/IEEE-754.html">floating point to binary conversion</a>

   <u>Decimal</u>
   For business applications (money); Essential to COBOL
   Unlike decimal floating point, NO ROUND-OFF ERRORS
   <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/index.aspx?link=ecmaspec%3a11.1.6">C# </a> decimal data type

   <u>BCD</u> (binary coded decimal) encoding takes more space than a binary encoding
   A decimal digit 0-9 requires 4 bits.
   Binary encoding of 255 can be done in 8 bits: 1111 1111
   BCD encoding of of 255 requires 3*4=12 bits: 0010 0101 0101
   Advantage: accuracy (solves floating point rounding problem)
   Disadvantages: limited range, wastes memory

   <u>Boolean</u>
   Range of values: two elements, one for true and one for false
   Could be implemented as bits, but often as bytes
   Advantage: readability
   
   <u>Character</u>
   Stored as numeric codings
   Most commonly used coding: ASCII 
   UNICODE 16-bit coding <a href="http://www.macchiato.com/unicode/chart/">(see unicode charts)</a> <a href="http://www.natural-innovations.com/wa/doc-charset.html">(see HTML unicode)</a> 
   UNICODE supports characters from most natural languages plus symbols
   Example: <font size=+2> &#208; </font> is the Icelandic Capital Eth
   Originally used in Java, C# and JavaScript also support Unicode
<!--   <form NAME="jukebox">    Enter a Unicode: <input TYPE="text" NAME="unicode" ID="unicode" VALUE=0000 SIZE="5" MAXLENGTH="4"> Then click: <input TYPE="button" ID="display" VALUE="Display" onclick='handleClick()'> -->


<b> Character String Types  </b>

   Values are sequences of characters
   Design issues:
   Is it a primitive type (Perl) or a special kind of array or class (C/C++)?
   Should length of strings be static or dynamic?

 o Character String Type Operations

   Assignment and copying
   Comparison (=, >, etc.)  
   Catenation
   Substring reference
   Pattern matching - <a href="./Manpages/perlrequick.txt">Perl</a> (try these out in vim)
  
     some metacharacters:
     ?    0 or 1 time 
     *    0 or more times
     +    1 or more times
     []   marks a character class to match a single character
     ^    negation inside [];  anchor at beginning of line otherwise
     $    marks end of line
     ()   substring deliminters  (must be escaped in vim)
     $1   refers to first matched substring (this is \1 in vim)
     {}   a{n} means match 'a' exactly "n" times

     some of Perl's abbreviations 
     \d is a digit and represents [0-9]
     \s is a whitespace character and represents [\	\t\r\n\f]
     \w is a word character	(alphanumeric or _) and represents [0-9a-zA-Z_]
     \D is a negated \d; it	represents any character but a digit [^0-9]
     \S is a negated \s; it	represents any non-whitespace character [^\s]
     \W is a negated \w; it	represents any non-word	character [^\w]
     The period '.'	matches	any character but "\n"

    Ex.
    $x = 'the cat in the hat';
	 $x =~ /^(.*)(at)(.*)$/; #$1 = 'the cat in the h'; $2='at'; $3=''(0 matches)

   What do these regexes match? 

      /^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z\d]+/   
      /[yY][eE][sS]/;
      /[0-9a-fA-F]/;	          
      /[^0-9]{4}/;          

   Substring replacement (substitution) syntax:

   s/regex/replacement/modifiers
   ex.
	/^'(.*)'$/$1/;	# strip	single quotes that occur at start and end of line

   Try out a few thing with <a href="./data2">this file</a> in vim.

 o Character String Type 

   Not primitive in C - must use char arrays and a few low-level utilities <a href="http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V40F_HTML/AQTLTBTE/DOCU_098.HTM">(see string.h)</a> 

   Not primitive in C++ (but provided in Standard Template Library string class)
   <a href="http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/compsci/docs/string.html">see docs</a> and <a href="./Code/C++/strings.cpp">sample code</a>

   Primitive in SNOBOL4 (a string manipulation language) ; many operations 
   and elaborate pattern matching

   Primitive in Java as a String class (don't need to include anything extra)

   o  Character String Length Options

     1. Static: COBOL, Java's String class
     2. Limited Dynamic Length: C/C++ \0 marks end of string in fixed array (<a href="./Code/C/strings.c">example</a>)
     3. Dynamic (no maximum): SNOBOL4, Perl, JavaScript

     Ada supports all three string length options

   o  Character String Type Evaluation

   Aids writability
   Inexpensive as a primitive type with static length-why not have them?
   Dynamic length is nice, but is it worth the expense?

   o  Character String Implementation

     1. Static length: need compile-time descriptor for length and address
     2. Limited dynamic length: may need a run-time descriptor for length 
        (not in C and C++)
     3. Dynamic length: need run-time descriptor for address, max length and 
        current length; allocation/de-allocation biggest implementation problem

<b> User-Defined Ordinal Types </b>

   A data type that denotes position in an ordered sequence - must be mapped to integers 

   <u>Enumeration Types</u>: All possible values are named constants in the definition
   C# example: enum days {mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun}; <a href="./Code/C/types.c">(see C example)</a>

   Design issues
   Can enumeration constant appear in more than one type definition, if so, 
   how is the type of an occurrence of that constant checked?

   Are enumeration values coerced to integer?

   Any other type coerced to an enumeration type?

   o Evaluation of Enumerated Type

   Aid to readability, e.g., no need to code a color as a number
   Aid to reliability, e.g., compiler can check operations (don't allow colors to be added) 
   No enumeration variable can be assigned a value outside its defined range

   Ada, C#, and Java 5.0 provide better support for enumeration than C++; e.g.
   enumeration type variables are not coerced into integer types

   <u>Subrange Types:</u> An ordered contiguous subsequence of an ordinal type
   Def: an ordinal type is countable and ordered (real numbers are not countable)

   Example: 12..18 is a subrange of integer type
   Adas design

        type Days is (mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun);
        subtype Weekdays is Days range mon..fri;
        subtype Index is Integer range 1..100;
   
        Day1: Days;
        Day2: Weekday;
        Day2 := Day1;
   
   o Subrange Evaluation

   Aids readability
   Makes clear that variables of subrange can store only certain range of values
   Reliability
   Assigning a value to a subrange variable outside range is a syntax error

   o Implementation of User-Defined Ordinal Types

   Enumeration types are implemented as integers
   Subrange types implemented like parent types with code inserted by 
   compiler to restrict assignments to subrange variables

<b> ARRAY TYPES </b>

   Arrays included in most languages

   An array is an aggregate of contiguous, homogeneous data elements where
   individual elements are identified by position relative to the first element

   o Array Design Issues

   What types are legal for subscripts?
   Are subscripting expressions in element references range checked?
   When is the subscript range bound (when is the size of array determined)?
   When does allocation take place?
   What is the maximum number of subscripts?
   Can array objects be initialized?
   Are any kind of slices allowed?

   o Array Indexing

   Indexing (or subscripting) is a mapping from indices to elements

    	array_name (index_value_list) ->  an element

   - Index Syntax
     Most languages use brackets

     FORTRAN, PL/I, Ada use parentheses
     Ada explicitly uses parentheses to show uniformity between arrays and 
     function calls; e.g. both are mappings


   - Arrays Index (Subscript) Types
     FORTRAN, C: integer only
     Pascal: any ordinal type (integer, Boolean, char, enumeration)
     Ada: integer or enumeration (includes Boolean and char)
     Java: integer types only

  
   - Range Checking
     C, C++, Perl, and Fortran do not specify range checking
     Java, ML, C# specify range checking

   o Array Allocation Categories

   <a href="./Code/C/arrays.c">C Example of all five methods</a>


   <u>Static:</u> the subscript range is statically bound and storage 
   allocation is also at compile time (not on the runtime stack)

   Advantage: efficiency (no dynamic allocation)

   <u>Fixed stack-dynamic:</u> the subscript range is statically bound, but 
   allocation is done at declaration time during function call
   Advantage: space efficiency 
   
   <u>Stack-dynamic:</u> the subscript range is dynamically bound and the 
   storage allocation is dynamic (on run-time stack)

   Advantage: flexibility (the size of an array need not be known until the 
   array is to be used)

   <u>Fixed heap-dynamic:</u> similar to fixed stack-dynamic: storage binding 
   is heap dynamic but the size of the array is fixed

   <u>Heap-dynamic:</u> binding of the subscript range and storage allocation 
   are both dynamic and can change during execution  

   Advantage: flexibility (arrays can grow or shrink during program execution)

   C and C++ arrays that include static modifier are static
   C and C++ arrays without static modifier are fixed stack-dynamic
   Ada arrays can be stack-dynamic
   C and C++ provide fixed heap-dynamic arrays
   C# includes a second array class ArrayList that provides fixed heap-dynamic
   Perl and JavaScript support heap-dynamic arrays

  o Array Initialization

   Some languages allow initialization at the time of storage allocation:

      // C, C++, Java, C#
      int list [] = {4, 5, 7, 83} <== an aggregate constant is assigned to list 

      char name [] = "freddie";   // C and C++

      char *names [] = {Bob, Jake, Joe};  // C and C++

      String[] names = {Bob, Jake, Joe};  // Java String objects


  o Array Operations

   APL has the most powerful array processing operations for vectors, matrixes 
   and unary operators (for example, to reverse column elements)
  
   Ada allows array assignment and catenation
 
   Fortran provides elemental operations because they are between pairs of 
   array elements; e.g. a pairwise sum of two arrays:

            1,2,3,4 + 2,3,1,5 = 3,5,4,9

   <a href="./Code/Perl/arrays.pl">Perl</a> array operations

  o Rectangular and Jagged Arrays

   An array in C has only one dimension, but you can create <a href="./Code/C/arrays.c">a abstract type of array of arrays</a> 

   A rectangular array is a multi-dimensioned array with all rows having the 
   same number of elements and all columns have the same number of elements

   A jagged matrix has rows with varying number of elements
   Possible when multi-dimensioned arrays appear as arrays of arrays 
   or when an array of pointers to a union type
   <a href="./Code/C/arrays.c">C example</a> 

  o Slices

   A slice is a method to reference a substructure of an array
   mechanism (only useful in languages that have array operations)

   Assume, the following array declarations in Fortran 95: 
   Integer, Dimension (10) :: Vector       // a 1-dimensional array
   Integer, Dimension (3, 3) :: Matrix     // a 2-dimensional array
   Integer, Dimension (3, 3, 4) :: Cube    // a 3-dimensional array
   
   Slice Examples:
   Vector (3:6) is a four element array
   Mat (:,2) is the second column of Mat  (an array)
   Mat (2:3,:) is the 2nd and 3rd rows of Mat  (a matrix)
   Cube (2,:,:) is a matrix
   Cube (:,:,2:3) is another 3-dimensional array 
  
   <IMG SRC="./fortran_slices.jpg"></a> 

   Ex. slices in <a href="./Code/Perl/arrays.pl">Perl</a>

  o Implementation of Arrays

   Access function maps subscript expressions to an address in the array 
   Access function for single-dimensioned arrays:

   address(list[k]) = address (list[lower_bound]) + ((k-lower_bound) * element_size)

   Accessing Elements Multi-dimensioned Arrays
   Two common ways:
   Row major order (by rows)  used in most languages
   column major order (by columns)  used in Fortran

   In row major, the physical address of the kth element in row i and col j is 
   computed as (where n_cols is the number of columns):

   array_starting_address + ((i * n_cols + j) * element_size)

   <IMG SRC="./array_address.jpg"></a> 

   Compile-Time Descriptors for arrays
   All arrays: starting address, element type, index type

   Single-dimensional: 
      index range (e.g. lower and upper bound)

   Multi-dimensional: 
      index range 1 ... index range n, number of dimensions

<b> Associative Arrays (Hash tables, Hash maps) </b>
<p>
 An unordered collection of data elements indexed by an 
  equal number of 
   values called keys 
<br/>
   User defined keys must be stored
<br/>
   Design issues: What is the form of references to elements
<br/>
   Example: <a href="./Code/Perl/spell_check.pl">a hash in Perl</a>
<br/>
   <a href="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.16/16.10/AssociativeArrays/index.html">supported in Java/C++/JavaScript</a>
