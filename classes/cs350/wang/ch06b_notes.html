<b>* RECORD TYPES</b>

   A possibly heterogeneous aggregate of data elements individually identified 
   by names (usually called fields)

   <u>Design issues</u>
   What is the syntactic form of references to the field? 
   Are elliptical references allowed? e.g. ellipsis (...) any omitted part of 
   speech that is understood

   <a href="./Code/C/structs.c">Ex: structs in C</a>

   <b>COBOL</b> ( level numbers show nested records )

      01 EMP-RECORD.
         02 EMP-NAME.
             03 FIRST    PIC IS X(20).
             03 MIDDLE   PIC IS X(10).
             03 LAST     PIC IS X(20).
         02 HOURLY-RATE PIC IS 99V99.

   Record Field Reference:   MIDDLE OF EMP-NAME OF EMP-RECORD 
   
   Fully qualified references include all record names

   Elliptical references allow leaving out some parts of record names as long 
   as the reference is unambiguous; e.g.

   FIRST, FIRST OF EMP-NAME, and FIRST of EMP-RECORD are elliptical references 
   to the employee's first name

   <b>Ada</b>
   Record structures are indicated in an orthogonal way:
  
        type Emp_Name_Type is record
               First: String (1..20);
               Mid: String (1..10);
               Last: String (1..20);
        end record;
         
        type Emp_Rec_Type is record
              Employ_Name: Emp_Name_Type;
              Hourly_Rate: Float;
        end record;
         
        Emp_Rec: Emp_Rec_Type;

   Record Field Reference: 
   Emp_Rec.Name    <==  dot notation - most commonly used


   <u>Operations on Records</u>
   Assignment is very common if the types are identical
   Ada allows record comparison
   Ada records can be initialized with aggregate literals

   COBOL provides MOVE CORRESPONDING:
   Copies a field of source record to the corresponding field in target record

   <u>Evaluation and Comparison to Arrays </u>
   Straight forward and safe design

   Records are used when collection of data values is heterogeneous

   Access to array elements is slower than to record fields, because 
   subscripts are dynamic (field names are static); e.g. myArray[i]

   Dynamic subscripts could be used with record field access, but would 
   disallow type checking and be much slower

<b>*  UNION TYPES </b>

   This variables can store different type values at different times during 
   execution

   <u>Design issues</u>
   Should type checking be required?
   Should unions be embedded in records?

   Unions:
    o  every member begins at offset 0 from the address of the union
    o  the size is the size of the largest member
    o  only one member value can be stored in a union object at a time

   <u>Discriminated vs. Free Unions</u>

   Fortran, C, and C++ provide union constructs with no language support for 
   type checking; the union in these languages is called free union; <a href="./Code/C/unions.c">Ex. C</a>

   Type checking of unions require that each union include a type indicator 
   called a discriminant
   
   Discriminated Union Type  
   Ex. Ada

         type Shape is (Circle, Triangle, Rectangle);
         type Colors is (Red, Green, Blue);
         type Figure (Form: Shape) is 
             record
                Filled: Boolean;
                Color: Colors;
                case Form is
                     when Circle => Diameter: Float;
                     when Triangle =>
                         Leftside, Rightside: Integer;
                         Angle: Float;
                     when Rectangle => Side1, Side2: Integer;
               end case;
            end record;

   <u>Evaluation of Unions: </u>
   Potentially unsafe construct if no type checking
   Java and C# do not support unions
   Reflective of growing concerns for safety in programming language
   
<p>
   *Note: unions and structures are prevalent in C system programming
    (<a href="./Code/C/Semaphores">see semaphore example</a>)
    C was developed to be a low-level system programming language 
    C is still the most popular choice for low-level programming
    For applications programming, the power of C is also its downfall

<b>*  POINTER AND REFERENCE TYPES </b>

   A pointer type variable holds a memory address or a special value, nil 
   Provide the power of indirect addressing
   Provide a way to manage dynamic memory
   A pointer can access memory that is dynamically created (e.g. heap)

   Pointers add addressing flexibility and control dynamic storage management
   
   <u>Design Issues of Pointers</u>
   What are the scope of and lifetime of a pointer variable?
   What is the lifetime of a heap-dynamic variable?
   Are pointers restricted as to the type of value to which they can point?
   Are pointers used for dynamic storage management, indirect addressing, or both?
   Should the language support pointer types, reference types, or both?
 
   <u>Pointer Operations </u>
   Two fundamental operations: assignment and dereferencing
   Assignment is used to set a pointer variables value to some useful address
   Dereferencing yields the value stored at the location represented by the pointers value
   Dereferencing can be explicit or implicit
   C++ has explicit operation via *; e.g. 

        j = *ptr

   sets j to the value located at ptr
   <IMG SRC="pointers.jpg"></a>
  
   <u>Problems with Pointers</u>
   Dangling pointer: A pointer points to de-allocated a heap-dynamic variable 
   Dangling object: An allocated heap-dynamic variable has no pointer (memory 
   leak)
   Cross-linked pointers: heap-dynamic variable with two pointers (sometimes
   desirable)

   Pointers in C/C++ powerful and dangerous; <a href="./Code/C/pointers.c">Ex. C</a>
   Explicit dereferencing and address-of operators
   (void *) can point to any type and be type checked but not de-referenced (<a href="./Code/C/pointers.c">Ex. C</a>)
   In C, pointers can point to pointers can point to pointers....
   (<a href="./Code/C/pointers.c">C double pointers</a>)
   
   Limited pointer arithmetic is supported in C/C++

       float stuff[100];
       float *p;
       p = stuff;
   
       *(p+5) is equivalent to stuff[5] and  p[5]
       *(p+i) is equivalent to stuff[i] and  p[i]
  
      p = p + stuff; <= not OK
 
   Pointers in Fortran 95 point to heap and non-heap variables that have the 
   TARGET attribute assigned in the declaration; Implicit dereferencing

   C-style pointers in C# are available only in unsafe code:

         unsafe {  
             int i = 10;
             int* px1 = &i;  
         }   

   <u>Reference Types</u>
   C++ includes a special kind of pointer type called a reference type that is 
   used primarily for formal parameters;
   C++ reference type behaves strictly like an alias (<a href="./Code/C++/functions.cpp">see C++ code</a> )
   In a reference, you never see the address and you have implicit assignment 
   and dereferencing - (<a href="./Code/C++/functions.cpp">see C++ code</a>)
   THERE IS NO EXPLICIT DEREFERENCING 

   Advantages of both pass-by-reference and pass-by-value 
   Java extends C++ reference variables to replace pointers entirely
   References refer to call instances
   C# includes both the references of Java and C pointers (in unsafe code)

   <u>Evaluation of Pointers</u>
   Dangling pointers and dangling objects are problems as is heap management

   Pointers or references are necessary for dynamic data structures--can't 
   design a language without them

   Representations of Pointers
   Depends on register and address size
   Large computers use single values 
   Intel microprocessors use segment and offset (2 16-bit addresses)
   
   Solutions to Dangling Pointer Problem

   o automatically de-allocate dynamic objects at the end of pointer's scope
     (Ada to some extent)

   Tombstone: extra heap cell that is a pointer to the heap-dynamic variable
   The actual pointer variable points only at tombstones (another indirection)
   When heap-dynamic variable de-allocated, tombstone remains but set to nil
   Costly in time and space -- not used in any major language

   Locks-and-keys: Pointer values are represented as (key, address) pairs
   Heap-dynamic variables are represented as variable plus cell for integer 
   lock value
   When heap-dynamic variable allocated, lock value is created and placed in 
   lock cell and key cell of pointer 
   Allows multiple pointers to point to the same variable (key is copied also)
   When memory is deallocated, the key is modified to prevent other access
  
   Best solution: no explicit deallocation possible
 
   <u>Heap Management</u>
   A very complex run-time process
   Single-size cells vs. variable-size cells

   <u>Two approaches to Garbage Collection</u>

   (1) eager approach
   reclamation is gradual (<a href="./Code/C/heap.c">C approach)</a>

   Evaluation: less efficient but you have the maximum amount of
   memory at any given time
   
   (2) lazy approach
   reclamation occurs when the list of variable space becomes empty
   The run-time system allocates storage cells as requested and disconnects 
   pointers from cells as necessary; garbage collection then begins

   Evaluation: more efficient but when you need it most, it works worst 
   (takes most time when program needs most of cells in heap)

<!--
   Every heap cell has an extra bit used by collection algorithm 
   All cells initially set to garbage
   All pointers traced into heap, and reachable cells marked as not garbage
   All garbage cells returned to list of available cells
  
   Marking Algorithm 
   <IMG SRC="marking.jpg"></a> 
   Variable-Size Cells
   All the difficulties of single-size cells plus more
   Required by most programming languages
   If garbage collection is used, additional problems occur
   The initial setting of the indicators of all cells in the heap is difficult
   The marking process in nontrivial
   Maintaining the list of available space is another source of overhead
-->

<b>*  BIT TYPES </b>

   (not covered in text)

   Systems programming often requires access to individual bits and data
   structures that take up less storage than primitive data types 

   The use of pointers and bit-level operators can almost replace assembly code 
   (Note: Only about 10 % of UNIX is assembly code - the rest is C)
   Example: <a href="./Code/C/structs.c"> C's bit fields</a> and
   <a href="./Code/C/bits.c"> displaying bit by bit</a>
