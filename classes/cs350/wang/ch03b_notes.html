<h3> Attribute Grammars </h3>
</SPAN>
  <u>Static Semantics</u> refers to the context-sensitive information in a 
  programming language that can be determined prior to runtime. Normally, 
  semantics describes the behavior of a program during execution 
 but in this context reflects the context-sensitive meaning of a program. 
 Examples of static semantics include 
 type checking and 
  the location of declarations. BNF/Context-free grammars (CFGs) are 
  well-suited to describe the context-free syntax of programming languages 
  but not easily context-sensitive information without becoming large 
  & clumsy. Since the size of a grammar determines the size of the parser, 
  attribute grammars enhance compilers with static semantics checking.
<p>
  An <u>attribute grammar</u> is a generative grammar that can describe both 
  the context-free and the context-sensitive syntax of a language. Attribute 
  grammars add context-sensitive information to CFGs by transporting semantic 
  information in a controlled fashion up and down the parse tree. Information
  is passed through synthesized and inherited attributes that are attached to
  the nodes of the parse tree.


<p>
  <u>Synthesized attributes</u> pass information from child to parent up the 
  tree. The parse tree is "decorated" with synthesized attributes in a 
  bottom-up fashion. If the value of a synthesized attribute on a leaf node
  is assigned before parsing begins (hence outside the parse tree), the 
  attribute is called intrinsic.

<p>
  <u>Intrinsic attributes</u> are synthesized attributes of leaf nodes, the
  value of which is known before the sentence is parsed. These attributes pass 
  external information (such as from the symbol table) up the parse tree. 

<p>
  <u>Inherited attributes</u> pass information from parent to child and from
  sibling to sibling. The overall effect is to move information down the 
  parse tree. The parse tree is "decorated" in a top-down fashion for inherited
  attributes. Each grammar symbol may have inherited or synthesized
  attributes, or both.

<p>
  Note: If the tree contains both inherited and synthesized attributes, a 
  combination of top-down and bottom-up order is used to decorate the tree.
<p>
<h4>Attribute Grammar Formal Definition </h4>
<pre>
  An attribute grammar is a context-free grammar G = &lt;S, N, T, P&gt; 
  with four additions:
 
 1. For each grammar symbol X &isin; N &cup; T, there is a set A(X) of 
    attribute values 

 2. Each rule has a set of functions that define certain attributes of the 
    nonterminals in the rule (also called semantic rule or semantic function)

 3. For each syntactic category X &isin; N, there are two finite disjoint sets
    I[X] and S[X] of inherited and synthesized attributes. For X = S, 
    I[X] = &empty;

 4. Each rule has a (possibly empty) set of predicates to check for attribute 
    consistency. Predicates (which return TRUE or FALSE) check semantic meaning,
    such as type rules. Predicates are inserted into the attribute grammar
    at any point in which you can determine whether the sentential form 
    conforms to the semantic rules of the grammar.

Example.
  Let   X_0 -> X_1 X_2... X_n  be a rule

  Functions of the form S(X_0) = f(A(X_1), ... , A(X_n)) define synthesized 
  attributes.

    In this case attributes for X_0 can be synthesized from any of X_0's 
    children; i.e., the terms  X_1 ... X_n in the production rule
     
      *synthesized attributes pass semantic information up a parse tree*

  Functions of the form I( X_j ) = f(A(X_0)), ... , A(X_n)), 1 &lt;= j &lt;= n, 
  define inherited attributes

  In this case attributes can be inherited from the parent and all siblings.

  Functions of the form I(X_j) = f(A(X_0)), ... , A(X_j-1)), 
  for 1 <= j <= n, can also define inherited attributes (to eliminate self 
  and siblings to the right)

     *inherited attributes pass information down and across the parse tree*
</pre> 
<h4>Attribute Grammar Example</h4>
<pre>
  A BNF grammar for a simple assignment statement:

  1. &lt;assign> -> &lt;var> = &lt;expr>
  2. &lt;expr> -> &lt;var> + &lt;var> 
  3.              | &lt;var>
  4. &lt;var> -> A | B | C

  This context-free grammar is limited: cannot check type rules. To check
  type, this grammar needs two predicates, one for each statement type:

  A = B
  A = B + C

  This grammar has two attributes:

  o actual_type: a synthesized attribute for nonterminals &lt;var> and &lt;expr>
                 used to store the actual type; e.g., int or real

  o expected_type: an inherited attribute for nonterminal &lt;expr>  
 
  1. Syntax rule:  &lt;assign> -> &lt;var> =  &lt;expr>

     Semantic rule: &lt;expr>.expected_type <- &lt;var>.actual_type (inherited)

  2. Syntax rule:  &lt;expr> -> &lt;var>[2] + &lt;var>[3]
    ([2] and [3] differentiate the three &lt;var> nonterminals)

     Semantic rule: &lt;expr>.actual_type <- 
                          if &lt;var>[2].actual_type == int) and
                             &lt;var>[3].actual_type == int)
                          then int else real        (synthesized)

     <b>Predicate:</b> &lt;expr>.actual_type == &lt;expr>.expected_type

  3. Syntax rule:  &lt;expr> -> &lt;var>
     Semantic rule: &lt;expr>.actual_type <- &lt;var>.actual_type 

     <b>Predicate:</b> &lt;expr>.actual_type == &lt;expr>.expected_type

  4. Syntax rule:  &lt;var> -> A | B | C 

     Semantic rule: &lt;var>.actual_type <- lookup (&lt;var>.string)

         <b>The parse tree for A = B + C</b>

                      &lt;assign>
                        /         \    
                  &lt;var>  =    &lt;expr>
             .actual_type      .actual_type 
                  |               .expected_type
                  A               /           \    
                            &lt;var>   +     &lt;var>
                          .actual_type    .actual_type
                              |                   |
                              B                   C 

        <b>The parse tree for A = C</b>
                      &lt;assign>
                      /           \  
                  &lt;var>  =  &lt;expr>
             .actual_type   .actual_type 
                  |            .expected_type
                  B             |    
                             &lt;var>   
                             .actual_type  
                               |      
                               C     
Assume:
   int A, B; real C
   A = B + C
   B = C

<h3>Describing the Meaning of Programs: Dynamic Semantics</h3>
<p>
   Dynamic semantics is strictly concerned with
 the behavior of a running program.
   There is no single widely acceptable notation or formalism for 
   dynamic semantics.
   There are three primary methods: Operation, Axiomatic, Denotational. 

<h4> Axiomatic Semantics </h4> 
<a name="axiomatic"></a>
<!-- <a href="#top">top</a> -->
<p>
  <u>Axiomatic Semantics</u>, which is based on formal logic, was designed
  as a means of formal program verification. The "view of a system" is 
  essentially a set of invariants (assertions) that hold or don't hold 
  throughout program execution. The meaning of a program is ultimately whether 
  the program is correct (all assertions hold) or not correct (at least 
  assertion fails). The set of predefined assertions (invariants) may be 
  deliberately selected to prove whatever is desired. 
<p>
 To prove the "correctness" of a programming language...
<p>
  Axioms and inference rules must be defined for each statement type 
 in the language
<p>
  An axiom is a logical statement that is taken to be true. 
<p>
 An inference rule is a way of  describing a transformation from one 
 assertion to the next.
<p>
  An assertion before a statement (a precondition) states the relationships 
  and constraints among variables that are true at that point in execution
 
<p>
  An assertion following a statement is a postcondition
  
<p>
  A weakest precondition is the least restrictive precondition that will 
  guarantee the postcondition
<p>
  Axiomatic Semantics Form:
<pre>
     {P} statement {Q}, 
</pre>
where {P} is the 
      pre-condition and {Q} is the post-condition
<p>
  An example:
<p>

  a = b + 1  {a > 1}
<p>

  One possible precondition: {b > 10}
  Weakest precondition:      {b > 0}
<p>
<b>Start by building an axiomatic semantics for assignment statements ...</b>
<p>
    An axiom for assignment statements:

<p>
    Let x = E denote an assignment statement
<p>
    {P} x = E {Q}
<p>

    The precondition is defined by the axiom:
<p>

    P = Q<sub>x->E</sub>
<p>

  Which means P is computed as Q with all instances of x in Q replaced by E.
   Example:
<pre>
        x = b / 2  {x < 5} 

      b / 2 < 5
      b < 5 * 2
      P = {b < 10}   <=this is the weakest precondition
</pre>
    
    Thus, the axiom for (x = E) is: 
<p>
    {Q<sub>x->E</sub>} x = E {Q}
<p>
 Next you need inference rules to prove the correctness of sequences of statements.
<p>
  1. The Rule of Consequence (where '=>' is "implies" and 'S' is "statement")
 
<pre>
      {P} S {Q}, P' => P, Q => Q'   <= antecedent
      --------------------------
            {P'} S {Q'}             <= consequence
    
 </pre> 
       example:
<pre>
       {P}  x > 5       {Q} x > 5 
       {P'} x > 10      {Q} x > 5  (still true)

       {P} x > 5       {Q}  x > 5 
       {P} x > 5       {Q'} x > 0  (still true)
 
</pre>
    This shows that a precondition can always be strengthened and a 
    postconditon can always be weakened!
<p>
   2. An Inference Rule for Sequences:
<pre>
       {P1} S1 {P2}
       {P2} S2 {P3}

       {P1} S1 {P2}, {P2} S2 {P3}
       --------------------------
           {P1} S1; S2 {P3}         <= relies on the Rule of Consequence
</pre>
   3. An inference rule for logical pretest loops (while loops)
<pre>
           {P} while B do S end {Q}


                (I and B) S {I}
         ------------------------------------
          {I} while B do S end {I and (not B)}

   where I is the loop <b>I</b>nvariant and must meet the following conditions:
   
   P => I               - the loop invariant must be true initially
  {I} B {I}             - evaluation of Boolean must not change validity of I
  {I and B} S {I}       - I is not changed by executing statements in the loop
  (I and (not B)) => Q  - if I is true and B is false, Q is implied
</pre>
  The loop terminates when (not B) is true
<p>
  The loop invariant <b>I</b> is a weakened version of the loop 
  postcondition, and also a precondition.
<p>
<b>I</b> must be weak enough to be satisfied prior to the beginning of 
the loop, but when combined with the loop exit condition, it must be 
strong enough to force the truth of the postcondition
<p>
<b>Another example...</b> <p>
<p>
The rules and axioms above can be used to define a rule for a repeat command.
<pre>
      { P } repeat C until B { Q and B }
</pre>
   "repeat C until B" is operationally equivalent to:
<pre>
      C; while (not B) do C end while
</pre>
   Making use of this fact, the proof rule for a repeat until is a
   combination of the rules for a sequence and a while loop:
<pre>
       { P } C { Q }, { Q and (not B) } C { Q }
      -----------------------------------------
        { P } repeat C until B { Q and B }
</pre>

   The loop invariant is Q, which is the postcondition of C.
<p>
<i>In similar fashion, an axiomatic semantics can be defined for 
 all constructs in the language!</i>
<p>
<b>Program Proof Process </b>
<p>
    The postcondition for the entire program is the desired result
<p>
 Work back through the program to the first statement.  If the precondition 
 on the first statement is the same as the program specification, the 
 program is correct.
<p>
 <b>Evaluation of Axiomatic Semantics</b>
<p>
  A good tool for correctness proofs and for reasoning about compact programs
<p>
  Developing axioms or inference rules for all statements in a language 
  is difficult
<p>
  A 2006 article in Scientific American discusses Alloy, a tool based on 
  axiomatic semantics, that can verify the safety of a cancer therapy machine. 
<p>

  For language users or compiler writers - usefulness in describing the 
   meaning of an entire programming language is limited 

<h4>Operational Semantics </h4>

  An operational semantics is a formal (mathematical) or an informal model of 
  the behavior of a programming language at execution. 
<p>
  The goal of an operational semantics is to precisely define the *behavior* of 
  a language; i.e., how the interpreter should work.
<p>

  An operational semantics of a programming language can be used during the 
  design process of the language or during the process of writing a compiler 
  or interpreter. 

<p>
  The first formal operational semantics was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda Calculus</a> (<a href="./curry.txt">reduction example</a>)

<p>
  Operational semantics can be implemented as an interpreter on an actual or on
  a simulated machine. 
<p>

  The change in the state of the machine (memory, registers, etc.) defines 
  the meaning of the statement

<p>
  A hardware pure interpreter would be too expensive
<p>

  A software pure interpreter also has problems:
     -detailed characteristics of the particular computer would make actions 
        difficult to understand
     -Such a semantic definition would be machine-dependent
<p>
  
  A better alternative: A complete computer simulation
<p>

  <b>The process:</b>
<p>

  Build a translator (translates source code to the machine code of an 
  idealized computer)
<p>

  Build a simulator for the idealized computer
<p>

  To use operational semantics for a high-level language, use a virtual machine 
  
<p>
  <b>Evaluation of operational semantics: </b>
<p>

  Good if used informally (language manuals, etc.)

<p>
  Extremely complex if used formally (e.g., VDL), it was used for describing 
     semantics of PL/I (which is nearly dead).
 
<p>
  <b>Example:</b>

<p>
  An informal example using virtual machine instructions to describe the 
  operational semantics (pp. 149):
<pre>
  <i>C for Statement                    Virtual machine instructions  </i>
                                              
  for ( expr1; expr2; expr3) {                expr1;
      ....                              loop: if expr2 == 0 goto out
  }                                            ...
                                              expr3;
                                              goto loop
                                        out:  ...    

  * assume (expr2 == 0) means expr2 is false 


  <i>Fortran Do Statement                  Virtual machine instructions  </i>
             
  do i = start, end, step                         i = start 
      ...                                   loop: if  i > end goto out  
  end do                                          i = i + step 
                                                  goto loop
                                            out:
</pre>

<h4> Denotational Semantics </h4>

  Concerned with semantics, assumes syntax and static semantics has been 
  verified elsewhere
<p>
  Based on recursive function theory

<p>
  The most abstract semantics description method
<p>

  Originally developed by Scott and Strachey (1970)
<p>

  The process of building a denotational specification for a language 
<p>

  Define a mathematical object for each language entity

<p>
  Define a function that maps instances of the language entities onto 
  instances of the corresponding mathematical objects.
<p>

  The meaning of language constructs are defined by only the values of 
  the program's variables.

<p>
  <b>Denotational Semantics vs. Operational Semantics </b>

<p>
  In operational semantics, the state changes are defined by coded algorithms.
<p>
  
  In denotational semantics, the state changes are defined by rigorous 
      mathematical functions.

<p>
  The components of a denotational specification:
<pre>
  (1) Syntactic categories and abstract production rules (enough to identify
      syntactic constructs -- not to parse them)
  (2) Semantic domains -- sets of mathematical objects
      A -> B is the set of functions with domain A and codomain B
  (3) Semantic functions to map objects of syntactic world to objects in 
      semantic world; e.g. &lt;bin_num> -> <b>N</b> is a function that maps
      the syntactic category &lt;bin_num> to the set of nonnegative decimal 
      integers. 
  </pre>   
  Note: The subscripts in the examples of denotational semantics are used
  to identify a particular mapping function; e.g., M<sub>dec</sub> refers to the mapping 
  function for decimal numbers; e.g.  M<sub>dec</sub>( &lt;dec_num> -> N ), which maps from 
  the abstract domain of &lt;dec_num> to the real domain of integers. </i>
<p> 
  <b>Denotational Semantics: Program State </b>
<p>
  The state of a program <b>s</b> is the values of all its current variables.
  <b>s</b> is a set of ordered pairs, where i is the name of a variable and v 
  is its current value:
<p>

   s = {&lt;i<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>>, &lt;i<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>> . . . , &lt;i<sub>n</sub>, v<sub>n</sub>>}

<p>
  Let VARMAP be a function that, when given a variable name and a state, 
       returns the current value of the variable
<p>

  VARMAP(i<sub>j</sub>, s) = v<sub>j</sub>
<p>

  <b>Example 1:</b> <b>Decimal Numbers</b>
<pre>

  The syntax:
  &lt;dec_num> ->   0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

                 | &lt;dec_num> (0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9)


  Denotational mappings, from &lt;dec_num> -> <b>N</b>, for above rules:
 
  M<sub>dec</sub>('0') = 0,  M<sub>dec</sub>('1') = 1, . . . , M<sub>dec</sub>('9') = 9
  M<sub>dec</sub>(&lt;dec_num> '0') = 10 * M<sub>dec</sub> (&lt;dec_num>)
  M<sub>dec</sub>(&lt;dec_num> '1) = 10 * M<sub>dec</sub> (&lt;dec_num>) + 1
  . . .
  M<sub>dec</sub> (&lt;dec_num> '9') = 10 * M<sub>dec</sub> (&lt;dec_num>) + 9

</pre>
<b>Example 2: Expressions </b>
<p>
  Syntactic component:

<pre>
  &lt;expr> -> &lt;dec_num> | &lt;var> &lt;binary_expr>
  &lt;binary_expr> -> &lt;left_expr> &lt;op> &lt;right_expr> 
  &lt;left_expr> -> &lt;dec_num> | &lt;var> 
  &lt;right_expr> -> &lt;dec_num> | &lt;var> 
  &lt;op> ->  + | * 
</pre>
  Expressions are decimal numbers, variables, or binary expressions having one 
  arithmetic operator and two operands, each of which can be an expression; e.g.
  786, NUM, A + 3, 768 * A + B
<p>
  Map expressions onto N &cup; {error}, were N is the set of integers and
  {error} is an error value (in this case undefined)
<p>
  &Delta;= denotes the definition of a mathematical function
  <b>.</b> (dot) refers to the child nodes of a node.
<p>
  The mapping function for expression <b>E</b> and state s:
<pre>
  M<sub>e</sub>(&lt;expr>, s) &Delta=
      case &lt;expr> of
        &lt;dec_num> => M<sub>dec</sub>(&lt;dec_num>, s)
        &lt;var> => 
             if VARMAP(&lt;var>, s) == undef
                  then error
                  else VARMAP(&lt;var>, s)

 <b>Example 3: Assignment Statements</b>
<p>
  An expression (as defined above) is denoted by <b>E</b>
  The state is denoted by s
  := denotes the assignment operator
  Maps a state to a state
<pre>
  M<sub>a</sub>(x := E, s) &Delta;=
      if M<sub>e</sub>(E, s) == error
         then error
      else s' = {&lt;i'<sub>1</sub>,v'<sub>1</sub>>,&lt;i'<sub>2</sub>,v'<sub>2</sub>>,...,&lt;i'<sub>n</sub>,v'<sub>n</sub>>}, where 
             for j = 1, 2, ..., n, v'<sub>j</sub> = VARMAP(i<sub>j</sub>, s) if i<sub>j</sub> != x;
              M<sub>e</sub>(E, s) if i<sub>j</sub> == x
</pre>
  notes: i<sub>j</sub> and x refer to variable names, not values
         s' is the state that is mapped from state s after the assignment
         operation x = E.
<p>
  <b>Example 4: Logical Pretest Loops (while loops)</b>
<pre>
  Assume:
  M<sub>sl</sub>(statement lists -> states)
  M<sub>b</sub>(Boolean expressions -> Boolean values)

   M<sub>l</sub>(state sets -> state sets)

   M<sub>l</sub>(while B do L, s) &Delta;= 
      if M<sub>b</sub>(B, s) == undef
          then error
          else if M<sub>b</sub>(B, s) == false
              then s
              else if M<sub>sl</sub>(L, s) == error
                    then error
                    else M<sub>l</sub>(while B do L, M<sub>sl</sub>(L, s))
</pre>
  <b>Loop Meaning</b>
<p>
  The meaning of the loop is the value of the program variables after the 
  statements in the loop have been executed the prescribed number of times, 
  assuming there have been no errors.
<p>

  In essence, the loop has been converted from iteration to recursion, where 
  the recursive control is mathematically defined by other recursive state 
  mapping functions
<p>
 
  Recursion, when compared to iteration, is easier to describe with 
  mathematical rigor

<b>  Evaluation of Denotational Semantics</b>

<p>
  * Can be used to prove the correctness of programs
<p>

  * Provides a rigorous way to think about programs

<p>
  * Can be an aid to language design

<p>
  * Has been used in compiler generation systems 

<p>
  * Because of its complexity, they are of little use to language users
