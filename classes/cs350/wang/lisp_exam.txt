                       CMPS 350 EXAM 1 - WTR 2011


************
PART I. 50 %
************

Questions taken, slightly reworded or reframed to cover the same concept, from  
Homeworks 1 - 5. Closed book and scantran. 55 questions (5 extra credit). You 
can come in anytime during the week to take this portion of the exam in order
to devote all lab time to coding. 

*************
PART II. 50 %
*************

This portion is open book and open computer. You will be asked to code one 
or more programs in your choice of two languages: Lisp, Ada, Prolog or Perl.
The level of difficulty is geared to students who have taken 3 quarters of
programming and similar to the lab problems. I assume you have completed the 
labs. If you think you might need more than 2.5 hours, see me in advance to 
arrange starting the exam earlier or staying later (up to 2 hours).

Create a subdirectory for this exam on sleipnir and copy these files into it:

       cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/exam1_files/* .

Pick any two of the coding problems.

Or you can use wget or http to grap the stuff here:
