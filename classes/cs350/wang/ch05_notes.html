 or more letters, digits or underscores. An underscore cannot be the final 
 symbol. An underscore cannot be followed by another underscore.
 
<p>
<b>Design issues for names in a language: </b>
<p>
LENGTH : 
   too short means poor readability: FORTRAN I: maximum 6;
      COBOL: maximum 30; FORTRAN 90 and ANSI C: maximum 31;
      Ada and Java: no limit and all are significant;
      C++: no limit, but implementers often impose one 
<p>
CONNECTORS ( underscore and dash ) : 
    most modern languages OK within limits but Pascal, 
 Modula-2, and FORTRAN 77 disallow
<p>
CASE SENSITIVITY : 
      Disadvantage is readability ( baby, Baby and BABY are all different
 names ) and
 writeability ( was that LetMeIn , letMeIn or  letmeIn???? )
  C++/Java  predefined names are mixed case (camel notation)
      - IndexOutOfBoundsException;
 C is case-sensitive b/c Unix is; C++/Java follow C; 
 Ada, however, is case-insensitive
 <p>
SPECIAL WORDS :
     improve readability; used to delimit or separate statement clauses; 
     e.g 'begin' and 'end'
<p>
<a name="variables"></a>
<h3>Variables <a href="#top">&uarr;</a> </h3>
  

  A variable is an abstraction of a memory cell and is
  characterized by five attributes:
<p><ol>
  <li> Name - not all variables have them (examples : dynamic memory variables 
      in the heap are referenced by pointers only  )
      Two variables using the same name must have different addresses (e.g. 
      variables in different program blocks or scopes) but two variables
      with different names may point to the same address (aliasing).
<p>
  <li> Type - determines the range of values of variables and the set of 
      operations that are defined for values of that type; in the case of 
      floating point, type also determines the precision
<p>
  <li> Address - the memory address with which the variable
      is associated (the lvalue)
      A variable may have different addresses at different times during 
      execution (e.g. local variables inside functions)
   
      A variable of the same name may have different addresses in the same
      scope; e.g. function overloading in C++ (see <a href="./mangling.cpp">name mangling</a>)
 <p>
   <li> Lifetime - The type of address binding determines the lifetime 
   of a variable (the 
   time during which it is bound to a particular memory cell);
  storage type determines lifetime ; scope and lifetime are related but
  not synonymous;
        - <a href="./Manpages/linkage_storage.txt">C/C++ linkage</a>
   - ( static variables in C/C++ have limited  
    scope  but have program lifetime; i.e. the second time you call
 a function and access a static variable declared in that function you
 are not creating a new variable location ) 
<p>
  <li> Value - the contents of the location by which the variable is associated.
<p>
  <li> Scope - The range of statements over which a variable is visible; e.g.
      visibility; May be static or dynamic
<p>

<p>
<a name="binding"></a>
<h3>Binding  <a href="#top">&uarr;</a>  <a href="#scope">&darr;</a> </h3>
   

 Binding is the association of one thing with another thing ; e.g.,
  a variable with its attributes or an operator and a symbol.
<p>
   The binding time is the time at which a binding takes place.
<p>
   <b>Possible Binding Times: </b>
<p>
     o Language design time --  bind operator symbols to operations;
     e.g. '+' is bound to the addition operation
<p>
     o Language implementation time-- bind floating point type to a 
     representation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating-point_standard">(see IEEE 754 standard)</a>
<p>
     o Compile time - ex. bind a variable to a type in C or Java by the compiler - this is static binding
<p>
     o Link time -- resolve external symbol references; ex. bind a variable to
     an address across multiple compilation units ( such as .o files ) ;
    external linkage (see <a href="./Manpages/ld.txt">ld manpage</a>)
   by the linker is static binding ; 
   Example <a href="./Code/C/file1.c">file1.c</a> and
    <a href="./Code/C/file2.c">file2.c</a> and
<p>
<p>
     o Load time -- bind a FORTRAN 77 variable to a memory cell; bind shared 
     objects libraries to an executable before runtime <br>
 (see <a href="./Manpages/loader.txt">loader manpage</a>) - this is also static binding

<p>
     o Runtime -- bind a nonstatic local variable to a memory cell ; bind a 
     method to a class object via polymorphism in C++  - this is dynamic binding
<p>
     A binding is static if it first occurs before run time and remains 
     unchanged throughout program execution (can be performed by compiler,
     linker or loader).
<p>

     A binding is dynamic if it first occurs during execution or can change 
     during execution of the program
</pre>
<p>
<a name="typebinding"></a>
<h3>Type Binding 
<a href="#top">&uarr;</a> 
<a href="#storagebinding">&darr;</a> 
</h3>
<p>
     - the process of binding a variable with a type.  Q:
 how is a type specified and when does the binding take place?
<P>

     If static, the type may be specified by either an explicit or an implicit 
     declaration 
<P>

     An explicit declaration is a program statement used for declaring the 
     types of variables; advantage: improves reliability
<P>

     An implicit declaration is a default mechanism for specifying types of 
     variables (the first appearance of the variable in the program);
     Advantage: writability; Disadvantage: reduces reliability <br>

<P>
     FORTRAN, PL/I, BASIC, and Perl provide implicit declarations;
     <a href="./Code/Perl/test.pl.txt">(see Perl example)</a>
<P>
<p>
 Type Inferencing :  Types are determined by the
 compiler from the context of the reference .
  Used by functional languages: ML, Miranda, and Haskell.
<P>
   <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DynamicTyping">Dynamic Type Binding</a> is typing that occurs at runtime (JavaScript and PHP)

<P>
    A language that uses dynamic typing is not "typeless" 
<p>
    Dynamic typing is not the same as "weak typing"

<p>
   A language is dynamically typed if most variables in 
   in that language are dynamically typed. A "language" is dynamically
 typed - not a program
<P>
    How the assignment statement behaves (in imperative languages)
 indicates whether that language is dynamically typed; e.g., JavaScript    <pre>     
    list = [2, 4.33, 6, 8];
    list = 17.3;
    list = "hello";
</pre>
    <a href="http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~donna/cs350/Code/JavaScript/test.html">run JavaScript example</a>
<p> 
    Advantage: flexibility (generic program units)
    Disadvantages: 
    High cost (dynamic type checking and interpretation)
    Type error detection by the compiler is difficult

<P>
<P>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">Duck Typing</a> 
  - "If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, 
 looks like a duck, it is a duck." Duck typing is a form of dynamic typing. 
 Duck typing is used by Perl, Javascript, Python, and others..

<a name="storagebinding"></a>
<h3>Storage Binding 
<a href="#top">&uarr;</a> 
<a href="#typechecking">&darr;</a> 
</h3>
<p>
   Storage binding of a variable is the binding of a variable name to
   a memory address
<p>
   The type of storage binding determines the lifetime of a variable;
   the lifetime of a variable is the time during which it is bound to a 
   particular memory cell
<P>
   Storage binding begins with memory allocation - getting a cell from 
   some pool of available cells
<p>
   Storage binding ends with deallocation - putting a cell back into the pool

<P>
  <b>Categories of Variables by Storage Binding</b> 

<P>
  (1)  Static--bound to memory cells before execution begins and remains 
       bound to the same memory cell throughout execution, e.g., all 
       FORTRAN 77 variables, C static and extern variables and C++ static 
       members in a C++ class 
<P>

       Advantages: efficiency (direct addressing), history-sensitive subprogram 
       support
       Disadvantage: lack of flexibility  (no recursion)

<P>
  (2)  Stack-dynamic--Storage bindings are created for variables when their 
       declaration statements are executed at runtime.

       If scalar, all attributes except address are statically bound

       Ex: local variables in C functions and C++/Java methods
           return values, arguments pass by value 

<P>
       Advantage: allows recursion; conserves storage
<p>
       Disadvantages: Overhead of allocation and deallocation;
        Subprograms cannot be history sensitive;
       Inefficient references (indirect addressing)
<P>

  (3) Explicit heap-dynamic -- Allocated and deallocated explicitly by the 
      programmer, occurs during execution
<p>
      Referenced only through pointers or references, e.g. dynamic objects in 
      C++ (via new and delete), all objects in Java
<p>
      Advantage: provides for dynamic storage management
      Disadvantage: inefficient and unreliable
<p>
  (4) Implicit heap-dynamic--Allocation and deallocation caused by assignment 
      statements
<p>
   
      all variables in APL; all strings and arrays in Perl and JavaScript
      Advantage: flexibility
      Disadvantages -- Inefficient, because all attributes are dynamic
 and loss of error detection; <a href="./Code/Perl/test.pl.txt">(see Perl example)</a>

<p>
* "Explicit stack dynamic" does not make sense
<p>
<a name="typechecking"></a>
<h3>Type Checking
<a href="#top">&uarr;</a> 
<a href="#strongtyping">&darr;</a> 
</h3>
<p>
   ensuring that the operands of an operator 
   are of compatible types
<p>

   ensuring that the arguments in a subprogram call are compatible with
    the parameters of the subprogram definition

<p>
   ensuring that the lvalue and the rvalue of an assignment statement
   are compatible
<p>

   A compatible type is one that is either legal for the operator, or is 
   allowed under language rules to be implicitly converted, by compiler-
   generated code, to a legal type

<p>
  automatic conversion is called a coercion <a href="./Code/C/types.c">(see C example)</a>

<p>
   C++ example of  both implicit (automatic) and explicit type casting
   (<a href="./Code/C++/bear.cpp">bear example</a>)
<p>
* A type error is the application of an operator to an operand of an 
   inappropriate type; whether 'const' qualifier (or similar keyword) is
   enforced by the compiler is an issue ; <a href="./Code/C++/bear.cpp">C++
   enforces const</a> ; <a href="./Code/C/types.c">C does not</a>
<p>

   If all type bindings are static, nearly all type checking can be static
<p>

   If type bindings are dynamic, type checking must be dynamic
<p>
   
<a name="strongtyping"></a>
<h3>Strong Typing
<a href="#top">&uarr;</a> 
<a href="#scope">&darr;</a> 
</h3>
<p>

 <i>A programming language is strongly typed if type errors are always 
 detected ( few or no implicit coercions )</i>
<p>
  most strongly typed languages are static typed  but not always 
   -  ML is strongly typed but also employs dynamic typing
  
<p>
   Advantage of strong typing: improves reliability - detects of the misuses 
   of variables that result in type errors
<p>
   Coercion weakens strong typing; Ada is more strongly typed than C - there
   is no implicit coercion: int i, int j; float x = i / j;  
<p>
    C/C++ is not strongly typed 
 ( parameter type checking can be avoided or completely
 ignored <a href="./Code/C/pointers.c">( see use of void * ); </a> ; unions are not type checked 

<p>
   Ada is the most strongly typed language ;
    C# is almost fully strongly typed ;
   Java is more strongly typed than C/C++ ( Java has half the 
     assignment coercions of C++ but its strong 
       typing is still far less than Ada ) ; no surprise- C/C++ is at the
 bottom
<p>
<b>Name Type Compatibility  : </b> 
   two variables have compatible types if 
   they are in either the same declaration or in declarations that use the 
   same type name
<p>

   Easy to implement but highly restrictive:
   Subranges of integer types are not compatible with integer types
   Formal parameters must be the same type as their corresponding actual 
   parameters (Pascal)

<p>
<b>Structure Type Compatibility : </b> 
   two variables have compatible types 
   if their types have identical structures; flexible, but harder to implement
; Ada supports assignment of all like structures 
<p>
   Design issues:
   Are two record types compatible if they are structurally the same but use 
   different field names?
<p>

   Are two array types compatible if they are the same except that the 
   subscripts are different? (e.g. [1..10] and [0..9]) - yes in Ada
<p>

  In C, enumeration types are compatible if spelling differs but 
   structure is the same <a href="./Code/C/types.c">(see C example)</a>
<p>
   With structural type compatibility, you cannot differentiate between types 
   of the same structure (e.g. different units of speed, both float)
<p>
<a name="scope"></a>
<h3>Scope <a href="#top">&uarr;</a> </h3>

   The scope of a variable is the range of statements over which it is visible
<p>
   The nonlocal variables of a program unit are those that are visible but not 
   declared there
<p>
   The scope rules of a language determine how references to names are 
   associated with variables
<p>
   Scope ruling are either dynamically or statically determined
<P>

   <u>Static Scope</u>
<p>
   Based on program text ; Ada uses static scoping rules and supports nested
   subroutines; <a href="ada.txt">(see Ada example)</a>

<p>
  The binding of a name reference to a variable address is done by compiler,
   linker or loader before runtime based on scoping rules; in C/C++ the
   compiler handles compilation unit scope (internal linkage), the
   linker handles program global scope (external linkage), and the loader
   handles references to external system libraries.

<p>
   Search process: search declarations, first locally, then in increasingly 
   larger enclosing scopes, until one is found for the given name
   Example <a href="./Code/C/file1.c">file1.c</a> and
    <a href="./Code/C/file2.c">file2.c</a> and
<p>
   

   Enclosing static scopes (to a specific scope) are called its static 
   ancestors; the nearest static ancestor is called a static parent

<p>
   Variables can be hidden from a unit by having a "closer" variable with the 
   same name

<p>
  In addition to compilation unit scope and global scope, C++ and Ada 
  have package (Ada) and class (C++) scope:
      In Ada:  'unit.name';  In C++: 'class_name::name'
     <a href="./Code/C++/bear.cpp">(see C++ example)</a> 

<p> Blocks are a common method of creating static scopes inside 
 program units--<a href="scope.cpp">(see C++ example)</a>

<p>
 C/C++/Java are static scoped languages; nested functions are supported in 
 GNU C but not ANSI C <a href="./Code/C/types.c">(see C example)</a>
<p>
   Evaluation of Static Scoping:
   
<p>
   Suppose the spec is changed so that D must now access some data in B

<p>
   Solutions:
<p>
   Put D in B (but then C can no longer call it and D cannot access A's 
   variables)
<p>
   Move the data from B that D needs to MAIN (but then all procedures can 
   access them)
<p>
   Same problem for procedure access
<p>
   Overall: static scoping often encourages or forces the use of global variables
<p>

   <u>Dynamic Scope</u>
<p>
   Based on calling sequences of program units, not their textual layout 
   (temporal versus spatial)
<p>

   Assume MAIN calls A and B, A calls C and D, D calls E, B calls E 
   Runtime stack:
<pre>
                            E
             C         D    D     D                      E 
        A    A    A    A    A     A     A          B     B     B 
   MAIN MAIN MAIN MAIN MAIN MAIN  MAIN  MAIN MAIN  MAIN  MAIN  MAIN
</pre>
   References to variables are connected to declarations by searching back 
   through the chain of subprogram calls that forced execution to this point
   based on program text <a href="ada.txt">(see Ada example)</a>
 <p>  
   Advantage: convenience
   Disadvantage: poor readability

<p>
<u>Referencing Environments</u>
<p>
   The referencing environment of a statement is the collection of all names 
   that are visible in the statement
<p>

   In a static-scoped language, it is the local variables plus all of the 
   visible variables in all of the enclosing scopes 
<p>
  
   A subprogram is active if its execution has begun but has not yet terminated

<p>
   In a dynamic-scoped language, the referencing environment is the local 
   variables plus all visible variables in all active subprograms

<p>
<u>Named Constants</u>
<p>

   a named constant is not a literal (a literal has no memory associated
 with it); a named constant is a variable bound to a value once when it is 
   bound to storage; improves readability and modifiability ;
    used to parameterize programs
<p>

   the binding of values to named constants can be either static (called 
   manifest constants) or dynamic
<p>

   the binding of a variable to a value at the time it is bound to storage is 
   called initialization; binding can be static or dynamic: 
   the value of a dynamic named constant is set once at runtime. Ex. <pre>

   const static int result = 2 * width + 1;   // width not known at compile time

  </pre>

<p>
  C# has static named variables ( keyword const ) and dynamic named constants
 ( keyword readonly )

<p> 
<a name="terms"></a>  
<H3>Terminology <a href="#top">&uarr;</a> </h3>

 The terms <u>name</u> and <u>identifier</u> are generally
 interchangeable. 
 An "identifier" is a name for a user-defined entity -- 
 a variable, a function, a label, a constant, etc. --
 
  or a predefined entity that comes with the language  --
  environment variables, system calls, library functions, etc.
 The keywords and reserved words of a language, which
 name the  statement constructs and basic data types, cannot be
  used as an identifier name.
<p>
The terms <u>keyword</u> and <u>reserved word</u> are interchangeable in 
 most languages. In C/C++/Java, the terms 'reserved word' and 'keyword' 
mean the same thing. In Fortran, a keyword is a word that is special only 
 in certain contexts. E.g.,<pre> 
   -Real VarName  (data type followed by a name, therefore Real is keyword)</pre>
 Whereas, in Fortran and Ada
 a reserved word (while, do, for, break) is a special
 word that cannot be used as a user-defined name. 
<p>
All identifiers are associated with a <u>type</u>. For example,
  a variable identifier may be a single-entity scalar type 
 (int, float, double), a  derived type (arrays, structures, 
 unions), an object type, an enumerated type, a function type, etc. 
 A function type has
  variable types associated
 with the return value and parameter(s).
 The type of the identifier determines its scope, lifetime, type checking, 
 initialization, and type compatibility. For example, 
 a C function type has global scope and external linkage, has 
 a lifetime of that of the executable, and has
 strict type checking that is controlled by function prototypes
 at compilation time.
<p> 
* <u>Primitive data types</u> refer to the scalar and derived 
  data types that come with the language. The implementation of
 those types is compiler specific. <a href="http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/dynaweb_docs/0650/SGI_Developer/books/CLanguageRef/sgi_html/apa.html">ANSI C primitive data types</a> include int, float, double, pointer, unsigned int, array, etc.
 A type is also categorized as an integral or a non-integral. Integral
 types are scalars that have discrete values (int, unsigned int, 
 char, enum, bool)

 Perl includes all the usual primitives as C and also
 a string as a scalar type and 
  an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">associative array</a>
 as a primitive data type. A language will generally include,
 by default, the capability
 to display the values of all primitive scalar datatypes.
 C's <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/printf.html">
 printf</a> is one of the more powerful tools for displaying the value of
 primitive types.
<p>
A <u>literal</u> is the source code representation of the value
 of a primitive data type. A literal has a type, but does not have a 
 memory address. This C++ code provides examples of literals:<pre>
  
    void test(char * str){
        str[0] = 'a';   // seg fault core dump
    } 
    int x = 5;  // '5' is a literal for an int data type with value 5
    test("hello"); // 'hello' is a string literal
    bool flag = false; // 'false' is a boolean literal in C++ </pre> 
    
<p>
<u>Camel Notation</u> refers to the use of mixed case in an identifier
 name; e.g. OutofBoundsError. Camel notation can improve 
 readability if used consistently (getName, getPhone, getAddress, etc.)
 and if the notation is intuitive and easy to remember.
 Otherwise, camel notation degrades readability and writeability.
<p>
The term <u><a href="http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V40D_HTML/AQTLTBTE/DOCU_026.HTM#lvalues_sec">lvalue</a></u> historically refers to
  the "left-hand" side
 of an assignment statement. The term <u>
<a href="http://h30097.www3.hp.com/docs/base_doc/DOCUMENTATION/V40D_HTML/AQTLTBTE/DOCU_026.HTM#lvalues_sec">rvalue"</a></u> historically
 refers to the "right-hand" side of
 an assignment statement. In an extension of the original definition,
 rvalues and lvalues do not need to
 be part of an assignment statement, but reflect whether or
 not the expression or variable is bound to a memory address or to a value.
  An rvalue is bound to a value and an lvalue is
  is bound to a memory address.
 Thus, a statement that expects an lvalue requires a variable that is
 associated with a memory address. An rvalue does not
 require storage space. An rvalue is  either a literal or the value of 
 an expression. The error "unmodifiable lvalue" means that the
 the statement needs a variable bound to a 
 memory address but instead has encountered a variable that either is not
 an lvalue or is an lvalue that cannot be modified. For example, 
 this code will not compile<pre>
   const int y = 5; 
   int x = 5;
   if ( x > 3)    // x is an lvalue and '3' is an rvalue 
      x++;        
   y = y + 1;     // y is an unmodifiable lvalue  
 </pre>   
<p>
    <u>Aliases</u> are two or more variable names that access the same 
 memory location. Aliases are created via pointers, reference variables, 
 C and C++ unions. Aliases are harmful to readability 
 (readers must remember all of them), maintainability and security.
<p>
The <u>runtime stack</u> (or just stack) is a portion of memory allocated
 to a process during execution that is used strictly for everything
 necessary to implement a procedure call (the code return address, the value of
 arguments passed in, and the value of local variables).
