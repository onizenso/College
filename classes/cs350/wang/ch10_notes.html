<B>The General Semantics of Calls and Returns </B>

    The subprogram call and return operations of a language are together 
    called its subprogram linkage

    Subprogram call actions:

    o Parameter passing methods
    o Binding nonstatic local variables
    o Save return address of calling program  (address of next statement)
    o Transfer of control to callee
    o Access to nonlocal variables if subprogram nesting

    Subprogram return actions: 

    o copy outmode parameters
    o deallocate memory (including stack)
    o restore control to caller

STACK ACTIVATION RECORDS FOR SIMPLE SUBPROGRAMS
</SPAN>
    "Simple"
    o local variables are static only (not stack-dynamic)
    o no recursion
    o subprograms are not nested

    Call Semantics:
    o Save the execution status of the caller
    o Carry out the parameter-passing process
    o Pass the return address to the callee
    o Transfer control to the callee

    Return Semantics:
    o If pass-by-value-result parameters are used, move the current values of 
      those parameters to their corresponding actual parameters
    o If a function, move the functional value to a place the caller can get it
    o Restore the execution status of the caller
    o Transfer control back to the caller

    Two parts of an executable: Code and Data 
    Layout of noncode part of an executing subprogram is the activation record
    An activation record instance is a concrete example of an activation 
    record (the collection of data for a particular subprogram activation)

    ACTIVATION RECORDS FOR SUBPROGRAMS WITH STACK DYNAMIC VARIABLES 
</SPAN>

   A more complex activation record is required to support subprograms with 
   stack-dynamic local variables.

   First, the compiler must generate code to cause implicit allocation and 
   de-allocation of local variables at runtime

   An activation record instance is dynamically created when a subprogram is 
   called

   The activation record format is fixed, but its size may be dynamic

   The a declaration of a stack dynamic variable does not change the size
   of the executable:
  
   Assume you compile various versions of a program with and without static
   and dynamic arrays of size 100 ints:

         $ gcc ./Code/C/hw10.c   

   and then run   

         $ size a.out

   The results follow. 'Size' provides the size of the text, data and bss
   segments in the executable. The BSS (block starting symbol) segment is 
   the data segment where unitialized static variables go.

   <DIV STYLE="border: dashed 1px; width: 400px;">

   </div>

   The runtime environment varies by processor, but the general layout of 
   memory for an executing program on most processors looks like this (the
   stack grows upside down):

    highest memory |---------------|
                   |    stack      |
                   |---------------|
                   |      &darr;        |
                   |               |
                   |               |
                   |               |
                   |               |
                   |---------------|
                   |      data     |
                   |---------------|
                   |      code     |
     lowest memory |---------------|

  On a Sparc processor, much of the runtime stack is loaded into registers -
  stack frames are large because they save register windows. From
  /usr/include/sys/frame.h:

  Stack frames in memory typically go from large to small memory addresses (the
  stack grows down instead of up). "UP" in normal stack terminology would mean
  moving in the direction of the last item pushed on the stack. But the runtime
  stack grows down, so "UP" moves toward the first item pushed on the stack and
  "DOWN" moves toward the last item pushed on the stack (the top of the stack).
   GDBs frame numbers reflect this:
   #0  fac (n=1) at hw10.c:120
   #1  0x0001090c in fac (n=2) at hw10.c:121
   #2  0x0001090c in fac (n=3) at hw10.c:121
   #3  0x000108bc in main () at hw10.c:114

   The terms "activation record" and "stack frame" are used interchangebly.

  Typical Activation Record for a Language with Stack-Dynamic Local Variables 
  and No Recursion:

       ----------------------  <- Stack top   low address
       |  Local variables   |                      
       |--------------------|

    <u>Dynamic Chain and Local Offset</u>

 Q: What is a dynamic link?

    The dynamic link is an address that points to the top of the activation
    record of the calling procedure. When the current function ends, its
    activation record is popped off - the top of the stack becomes the dynamic 
    link address.

 Q: Why is a dynamic link necessary?

    If the size of the local variables are not known at compile time (as is 
    the case of stack dynamic arrays) then the function may use memory past 
    the activation record. The dynamic link is absolutely critical.

 Q: What is the dynamic chain (or call chain)?

    The collection of dynamic links in the stack at any given time is called 
    the call chain. The call chain traces back through the activation 
    records of each function, ending in main.

 Q: What is the local offset?

    Local variables can be accessed by their offset from the beginning of the 
    activation record. This offset is called the local_offset. The local_offset
    of a local variable can be determined by the compiler at compile time.
    
 Q: What additonal information is required to support recursion?

    Dynamic stack activation records allow for the possibility of multiple 
    simultaneous activations of the same subprogram (recursion). The stack 
    activation record must also hold the return value from the recursive call.

       ----------------------
       |   Return Value     | <= return value from the recursive call 
       ----------------------
       |  Local variables   |          
       |--------------------|     
       |   Parameters       |      
       |--------------------|     
       |   Dynamic Link     |   
       |--------------------|
       |   Return Address   |

IMPLEMENTING NESTED SUBPROGRAMS IN STATIC SCOPED LANGUAGES
</SPAN>
 Note: this is not the same topic as passing a nested subprogram as a 
 parameter (ch. 9 covers that topic)

 Implementing static scoping in a language that does not support nested 
 subprograms is simple: a variable is either local to its function or has 
 scope across the compilation unit or the executable (blocks are one exception 
 and are discussed below). Binding to global variables is done at compile time.
 A reference to local variable X in function foo is resolved at runtime by 
 using the local_offset to X (which the compiler determined) into foo's 
 activation record. 

 If a static-scoped language (Fortran 95, Ada, JavaScript, GNU C) use 
 stack-dynamic local variables and allow subprograms to be nested, the problem
 is not so easy. Example: If foo is nested in function foobar and X is declared
 in foobar, then resolving X in foo requires binding to X in the stack frame 
 of foobar.

 The process of locating a non-static non-local reference in another frame on
 the stack is:
 o Find the correct activation record instance
 o Determine the correct offset within that activation record instance

 Static semantic rules guarantee that all non-local variables that can be 
 referenced have been allocated in some activation record instance that is 
 on the stack when the reference is made; i.e., if function foo is nested in 
 function foobar, foo will never be called unless foobar is called first.

 Static chains are the primary method of implementing accesses to non-local 
 variables in static-scoped languages with nested subprograms

 A static chain is a chain of static links that connects certain activation
 record instances

 The static link in an activation record instance for subprogram A points 
 to one of the activation record instances of A's static parent

 The static chain from an activation record instance connects it to all of 
 its static ancestors

 A static link is added to the activation record in addition to dynamic link 

 Access to nonlocals is (chain_offset,local_offset) pair known at compile time
   
 The actual name of the variable is not needed to find the value on the stack

 Example Pascal Program:

  program MAIN_2;
  |   var X : integer;
  |
  |   procedure BIGSUB;
  |   |  var A, B, C : integer;
  |   |
  |   |  procedure SUB1;
  |   |  |  var A, D : integer;
  |   |  |  begin 
  |   |  |      A := B + C;  #1 references A in SUB1 (0,2)
  |   |  |_ end;  { SUB1 }
  |   |
  |   |  procedure SUB2(X : integer);
  |   |  |  var B, E : integer;
  |   |  |
  |   |  |  procedure SUB3;
  |   |  |  |  var C, E : integer;
  |   |  |  |  begin { SUB3 }
  |   |  |  |    SUB1;
  |   |  |  |    E := B + A:    #2 references A in BIGSUB (2,3) 
  |   |  |  |_ end; { SUB3 }
  |   |  |
  |   |  |  begin { SUB2 }
  |   |  |    SUB3;
  |   |  |    A := D + E;       #3 references A in BIGSUB (1,3) 
  |   |  |_ end; { SUB2 }
  |   |
  |   |  begin { BIGSUB }
  |   |    SUB2(7);
  |   |_ end; { BIGSUB }
  |
  |   begin
  |     BIGSUB;
  |_  end; { MAIN_2 }

    Call sequence for MAIN_2
    
         MAIN_2 calls BIGSUB
         BIGSUB calls SUB2
         SUB2 calls SUB3
         SUB3 calls SUB1

 Note that the static chain points to the bottom of the next AR in chain
    ////
 An alternative to static chains is a "display":

 Static links are NOT stored in the activation record but in a single array 

 The contents of the display at any given time is a list of addresses of 
 the accessible activation record instances

 Accesses to nonlocals require exactly two steps for every access:
 display_offset + local_offset takes you directly to the address

 Displays not widely used in modern languages

<SPAN STYLE="Background-Color : yellow">
IMPLEMENTING BLOCKS
</SPAN>

    Blocks are user-specified local scopes for variables (similar to static
    scoping of nested subprograms)

    An example in C:
    int x = 3;
    {
      int x = 5;
    }

    The lifetime of inner x begins when control enters the block and ends
    when control exits the block; the scope of inner x is within block only

    Must implement so that access to x does not interfere with the variable x 
    in another scope

    Implementing Blocks (Two Methods):

    (1) Access is by static chain process as with nested subroutines 

        Treat blocks as parameter-less subprograms that are always called 
        from the same location

        <i>Each block has an activation record</i>; an instance is created each 
        time the block is executed


    (2) Since the maximum storage required for a block can be statically 
        determined, this amount of space can be allocated after the local 
        variables in the activation record; each block is a "static" part of 
        the AR of the procedure it belongs to (ANSI C does this); block
        variables are pushed and popped off a "stack" of locals in that area; 
        access to a variable is resolved to the most recent instance of that
        variable on the stack <a href="./Code/C/blocks.c">see code</a>
        Example: What happens at reference d = 5?
   <table> <tr>

<B>IMPLEMENTING DYNAMIC SCOPING</B>
</SPAN>

 *this is not limited to languages with nested subroutines

 Access to non-local variables in dynamic-scoped languages can be 
 implemented in at least two ways (deep access and shallow access)

  <i>The semantics for deep and shallow access is identical</i>

 In deep access, access to nonlocal variables is facilitated by tracing 
    the scope all the way back to the calling procedure. The first instance of 
    the variable in the call chain is used. The call chain consists of the 
    same dynamic links that are used for non-nested function calls.

    In shallow access, a data structure separate from the runtime stack
    maintains a trace of the variables. Each variable has its own stack. 
    Access to a nonlocal variable means that the array of variable stacks is 
    searched. The top of the stack holds the most recent instantiation of that 
    variable, and is used.

    <u>Deep Access</u> 

    Non-local references are found by searching the activation record instances
    on the dynamic chain 

    Similar to <i>static chain</i> access in nested subroutine (but w/ dynamic
    link not static link) 
  
    *The dynamic link points to the top of the activation record instance of 
    the calling program unit (see earlier example).
   
    Example: 

       void sub3() {
         int x, z
         x = u + v;
         ...
       }
       void sub2() {
         int w, x
         ...
       }
       void sub1() {
          int v, u;
          ...
       }

       void main() {
          int v, u, y;
          ....
       }

    Stack: 
  + -------+
  |  sub3  |
  |  x z   |
  | x= u+y | 
  +--------+
  |  sub2  |
  |  w x   |
  +--------+
  |  sub1  |
  |  v u   |
  +--------+
  |  sub1  |
  |  v u   |
  +--------+
  |  main  |
  |  v u y |
  +--------+

   What happens when sub3 references x, u, and y?

   By dynamic scoping the dynamic chain offset from sub3:
   Access to x is 0 to sub3
   Access to u is 2 to sub1
   Access to y is 4 to main 

   <u>Shallow Access:</u> 

   Put locals in a central table with an entry for each variable name

   Each variable adds a stack entry for each instantiation  

   EXAMPLE:
   An implementation of Shallow Access for Dynamic Scoping for same code: 

   --------------
   | sub1 | sub1 |
   ---------------               -------
   | sub1 | sub1 |               | sub3 |
   ---------------------------------------------
   | main | main |  main |  sub2 | sub2 | sub3 |   
   ---------------------------------------------
     v        u       y       w      x    z 

   From sub3
   Access to x is to sub3
   Access to u is to sub1 
   Access to y is to main

   (identical semantics to that of deep access) 

   A comparison:

   Def: 
   Subprogram linkage: The subprogram call and return operations of a 
   language are together called subprogram linkage. 

   Deep access provides faster subprogram linkage but slower access to
   nonlocals

   Shallow access provides faster access to nonlocals but slower
   subprogram linkage
