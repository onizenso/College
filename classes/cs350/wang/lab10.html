<h3>CS 350: Lab 10 "Introduction to C#"</h3>

<p>
<font color=red>Due: last day of classes</font><br/>

 Note: this lab is extra credit. That means that if you complete the
 lab you will have 10 extra points added into your
 lab grade  which will then be added into your overall grade.

<p>
 Before starting this lab you should read and understand the
 code in <a href="./Code/C_sharp">sample1.cs through sample6.cs</a>
 (you don't need sample7.cs on event handling
 for this lab). Copy the code into your working directory:<pre>

    $ cp /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/C_sharp/* .
</pre>
 In particular, you need to understand the concepts of
 properties and interfaces in C#. Properties are like  short-cut get and
 set methods in C++.
 Interfaces are like C++ abstract classes. Recall that an abstract class
 is one with at least one pure virtual function and, because of this, 
 can never be instantiated. In C# - an abstract class is formalized 
 and denoted by the keyword 'interface.' In an interface,
  all methods must be implemented in the derived class (i.e., all
 pure virtual methods).
 Start with this code below. It will not compile until you make
 the additions as listed:
<pre>
<div style="border: dashed 2px; margins: 5 5 5 5; padding: 5px"> 
namespace Assignment
{
  public class Application
  {
    static void Main()    
    {
      double rectWidth = 8.75f, rectHeight = 20.5f;
      IShape shape1 = new Rectangle(rectWidth, rectHeight);

      double triBase = 5.5, triHeight = 12.25f;
      IShape shape2 = new Triangle(triBase, triHeight);

      Console.WriteLine("area of type '{0}': {1}", shape1, shape1.Area);
      Console.WriteLine("area of type '{0}': {1}", shape2, shape2.Area);
    }
  }

  public interface IShape
  {
    double Area
    {
      get;  // concrete classes must implement IShape.Area.Get{}
    }
  }
}
</div>
</pre>
 Make these additions to the above code. <i>You do not need to change any of
 the existing code.</i> After making the necessary changes, your code
 should compile.
 Put all your code in the Assignment namespace and
 in the same file:
<ol>
<li>Add a virtual method <pre>
      void Display();
  </pre>
  to the IShape interface. Display will write 
 all attributes particular to each IShape object. For example, for a 
 rectangle object you should display this: <pre>
    I'm a rectangle! I have width 30 and height 40.
</pre>
<p>
<li>Add three public derived classes: Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle. 
 These three classes will inherit from 
 the IShape interface. Rectangle has a height and width, Triangle has
 a base and height, and Circle has a radius.
  In each class you must implement the
  IShape.Area property's implicit Get{} method. Get{} will 
 calculate and return the respective area of the IShape type.
 <p>
<li> Add a Radius property to Circle to both set and get the radius value. 
 Test it with<pre>
      shape3.Radius = 3.5f;
      Console.WriteLine("I just set my Radius to '{0}'.", shape3.Radius);
</pre>
<li> Add some code to Main to test every thing. For example, 
 construct a Circle object and test Circle's Radius property for both 
 set and get.  Add calls to Display() for each object. Your output
 should look something like this:<pre>

   I just set my Radius to '3.5'.      
 
   I'm a rectangle!I have width 8.75 and height 20.5
   I'm a triangle! I have base 5.5 and height 12.25
   I'm a Circle!   I have radius 3.5

   area of type 'Assignment.Rectangle'     : 179.375
   area of type 'Assignment.Triangle'      : 33.6875
   area of type 'Assignment.Circle'        : 38.465

</pre>
 </ol>
