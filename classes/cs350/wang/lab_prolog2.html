The material for this lab is derived from "Tutorial 2: Operators and Arithmetic" of James Power's <a href="http://www.cs.may.ie/~jpower/Courses/PROLOG/">Prolog tutorial</a>.
<p>
 In this lab you will use Prolog to compute some arithmetic functions.
 You need to understand the concept of a "variable" in Prolog.
 A variable is part of a predicate clause in Prolog. Variables are not 
 assigned values in memory locations, as is the case in imperative languages.
 Variables may be bound to a value by the 'is' operator, but within a single
  predicate clause, a variable cannot change value. Variables must be
 bound to a value before evaluation.
 How Prolog handles variables is shown by the following predicate clauses:
<pre>
  | ?- I is I + 1.  <= this is an error because 'I' does not have a value 
  uncaught exception: error(instantiation_error,(is)/2)

  | ?- I is 6.  <== clause satisfied by I = 6
  I = 6

  | ?- I is 6, I is I + 1.  <= clause satisfied by I=6 and I=7  (impossible) 
  no

  | ?- I is 6, J is I + 1.  <= clause satisfied by I=6 and J=6+1
  I = 6
  J = 7
  yes

  | ?- N is 2, P is N * 2. <= satisfied by N=2 and P = 2*2" 
  N = 2
  P = 4
  yes

  | ?- I is 6, I is 7.  <== satisfied by I = 6 and I=7  (impossible)
  no
</pre>
You also need to know how to do something in Prolog that you would normally
 do with a function in an imperative language. For example, how would you 
 achieve the result of this simple function in Prolog?<pre> 
  /* convert fahrenheit to celsius */
  float convert ( float far ) {
     return 5/9 * ( far - 32)
  }
</pre>
Since Prolog is a logic language, first state the problem as a logical 
expression:
<pre>
   For all X, if R is 5/9 * (X - 32), then R is the celsius conversion of X.
</pre>
The equivalent Prolog predicate rule is shown below (R denotes result). Note
 that you cannot use numbers in predicate names.
<p><pre>
   convert(X,R) :- X, R is 5/9 * (X - 32).   
</pre>
What about a function to return the absolute value of an integer?
<pre>
   int abs ( int num ) {
     if (num < 0 ) return -num
     else return num;
   }
</pre>
This is expressed in predicate logic as: "for all X, X < 1, if R is
-X OR for all X, X >= 0, if R is X, then R is the absolute value of X. And in Prolog:
<pre>
   abs(X,R) :- X < 1, R is -X. 
   abs(X,R) :- X >= 1, R is X. 

</pre>

<hr> 
Write Prolog rules to accomplish the following.
<i> Add a comment before each rule, explaining what the Prolog rule means.</i>
An operator you might find useful is  <pre>
idiv(X,Y,R) :- Y>0, R is X // Y.
</pre>
   which performs integer division. 
<pre>
The 'rem' operator returns the remainder of integer division, which is
 also useful.
<p>
1. Return a number incremented by 1
   Example: inc(5,X). should display X=6

2. Return signum(x), which is 1 if x>0, 0 if x=0, and -1 if x < 0 
   Example: signum(-7,X). should display X=-1.

3. Return the maximum of X and Y, or X if equal
   Example: getMax(5,10,X). should display X=10.

4. Return TRUE if X >= Y
   Example: isMax(5,10). should display No.  

5. Return the maximum of three numbers
   Example: max3(5,10,3,X). should display X=10.  

6. Return TRUE if N is even

7. Return TRUE if N is prime

Create a single file lab05.pl. Create a log file where you test all rules
in the Prolog interpreter. Email both files as attachments to me.

EXTRA CREDIT<p>
The extra credit pertains to Prolog's ability to behave as a parser
 for BNF grammars. Complete the assignment <a href="lab05_ec.pl">here</a>.
