<h3> Abstract Data Types and Encapsulation  </h3>

Process abstraction is realized by subprograms
<p>
 Data abstraction is realized by user-defined abstract data types (ADTs)
<p>
 ADTs promote encapsulation, modularity, information hiding, and genericity
<p>
 ADTs paved the way to object-oriented methodology; 
 full OOP includes the concepts of
 objects, inheritance, template classes and polymorphism 
 <p>
 An abstract data type is a user-defined data type 
 that satisfies two conditions:
<p>
Modularity: The representation of and operations on objects of the 
 type are defined 
in a single syntactic unit; also, other units can create objects of the
  type.  Modularity supports reusability and good program organization.
<p>
Encapsulation: The representation of objects of the type is hidden 
 from the program units that use these objects, so the only operations
  possible are those provided in the type's definition. Encapsulation
  supports security and reliability. (this is the use of private in C++)
<p>
Parameterization: The ability to define a generic data type
 is optional. Generic data types promote code reusability 
 (Ada and C++ but not Java include this)
<p>
C++ Standard Template Library (STL) - 
<p>
 The STL, a later edition to the C++ standard,
  is a set of abstract datatypes, functions, and algorithms 
 designed to handle user-specified datatypes. Each of the abstract 
 datatypes also contains useful functions, including overloaded operators, 
 to access them. The underlying methoology of the STL is generic programming - 
 the implementation of algorithms or data structures without being dependent 
 on the type of data being handled. For instance, the STL vector 
 container can store a vector (a resizable array) of any object you desire. 
 In C and non-STL C++, you can use arrays to get a similar feature, but 
 arrays are limited to a single type of data structure. Moreover, the STL 
 provides some nice features such as handling memory for you (no memory leaks), 
 and it is also safer (no buffer overflow issues when using vectors or 
 similar data structures).

<p>
  Simula provided encapsulation but not information hiding. 
 Ada, C++ and Java provide all three. 
ObjectAda now has full OOP support
  with classes.

<h3>Ada</h3>

Ada was designed for reliability, large team projects, embedded systems,
<p>
Ada introduced and embodies many of the modern principles of
 software engineering
<p>
Ada's design for exception handling was state-of-the-art in 1980 and the
only widely used language with exception handling until C++
<p>
One aspect of reliability is to catch as many errors as possible
 before runtime; Ada is strongly typed: there is no assignment coercion
<p>

The encapsulation construct is the package:
<li>Specification package (the interface with .ads extension)

<li>Body package (implementation of entities in the specification with .adb
 extension)

<li>Provides information hiding through hidden types named in the spec package
 with keyword private:
<pre>
  package  is
       type NODE_TYPE is private;
     private
       type NODE_TYPE is
           record
           end record; </pre>
        
<li> Private types have built-in operations for assignment (deep copy)
 and comparison with = and /= 

<li> Limited private types have no built-in operations
 
 
<li> Ada Generic Packages make the stack type more flexible by making the 
 element type and the size of the stack generic

<pre>
   package INT_STACK is new GENERIC_STACK(100, INTEGER);
   package FLOAT_STACK is new GENERIC_STACK(500, FLOAT); </pre>

<h3> Encapsulation </h3>

 A means of organizing *large* programs into smaller divisable 
 units. Division into subprograms doesn't solve the problem
 solve since subprograms need data. <p>

  Some means of partial compilation (compilation units that are smaller 
 than the whole program)
 <p>
   Obvious solution: a grouping of subprograms that are logically related 
 into a unit that can be separately compiled (compilation units)
 <p>
 Compilation units are encapsulations  - access across a compilation
 unit must be intentional
<p>
 languages with strong encapsulation (Ada and Java) make a 
 compilation unit one class or procedure
