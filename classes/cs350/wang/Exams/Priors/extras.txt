32. The dangling else problem can be solved by
    A. forcing mandatory statement blocks (such as with curly braces).
    B. a static semantics rule.
    C. both A and B
ANS: C

12. Consider the grammar

  S -> AB | AD
  A -> Aa | b
  B -> Bb | a
  D -> cDc | d

  The following is a valid string in the language generated by the grammar.

  baaaab  (T/F)
ANS: A (true)


2. This C code:

     float u2 = 77.77;
     printf("%f",u2);

  displays

      77.769997

  instead of 77.77. This is because

  A. floating-point decimal numbers are stored in base 2 format
  B. .77 is not a negative power of 2
  C. both A and B are true


17. All functions in Java must exist inside a class. (T/F)
ANS: A


16. What is true about this Perl code?

      $sum = 10;
      $sum = 'hello';

    A. it demonstrates dynamic typing for string and numerical types
    B. it demonstrates dynamic typing for scalar and array types
    C. it will produce a runtime error
ANS:  A


19. Consider the following C++ code.

  void test()
  {
     try  {
 . . .
     }

  The next statement after the try block must be a catch block. (T/F)
ANS: A (true)


43. What is true about this C# code?

 public interface IShape
  {
    double Area
    {
      get;
    }
  }

  A. A concrete class must implement IShape.Area.Get{}
  B. This is an example of ownership.
  C. both A and B
ANS: A

44. The statements

    IShape shape1 = new Rectangle(rectWidth, rectHeight);
    cout << shape1.Area().

   will call the above code in #43. (T/F)
ANS: B (false)

38. What is true about this Perl statement to parse <filename>?

    while (@ARGV) {
         if ($ARGV[0] eq '-f') { ...

   A. a 'last' statement in this block will exit the while loop
   B. there should be two shifts in this block
   C. both A and B

39. The following Perl statement will remove all spaces from $line. (T/F)

     $line =~ s/ +//g;

40. In the following Perl statement

    $table{@words[0]} = @words[1];

  A. @words[0] accesses the first element in a hash table
  B. @words[0] accesses the first element in an array

7. Using the virtual machine instructions given in Section 3.5.1.1, give an
   operational semantic definition of the Java do-while statement.

ANS:
    Syntax:

    do Statement while ( Expression ) ;

    A do statement is executed by first executing the Statement. Then
    Expression is executed. Statement is executed until Expression is false.

 loop: Statement
       if Expression == 0 goto out
       goto loop
 out:  .


15. Write a denotational semantics mapping function for the Java do-while
    statement.

ANS:
   The BNF grammar for a post-test loop:
   <DoStatement> -> do <S> while ( <B> ) ;

  Assume:
  Msl(statement list -> state)
  Mb(Boolean expression -> Boolean value)
  Ml(state set -> state set)

  Ml(do L while B, s) Delta=
      if Msl(L, s) == error
             then error
      else if Mb(B, s) == undef
             then error
      else if Mb(B, s) == false
             then s
      else Ml(do L while B, Msl(L, s))


show(X) :- X>0, write(X), X2 is X-1, show(X2), X>0. 
squares(X) :- X>0, R is X*X, write(R), X2 is X-1, squares(X2).
