CMPS 350 Exam 1  Week Four Questions

27. Assume you want all strings in a language to end with the same number of 
    digits that they start with: 12a23 is OK but 12a7 is not. This language 
    A. can be defined with a regular grammar.
    B. can be defined with a BNF grammar.
    C. can only be defined with an attribute grammar.
<!-- 27. ANS: B --!>

28. What is Size in the following attribute grammar? (x <- 5 means x is 
    assigned value 5)

       <astring> ::= <astring>[2] a
       Size(<astring>[2]) <- Size(<astring>) + 1  

   A. a synthesized attribute        B. an inherited attribute 
<!-- 28. ANS: B --!>

29. In an attribute grammar, the parse tree is decorated with inherited 
    attributes 
    A. from the top down.       B. from the bottom up. 
<!-- 29. ANS: A --!>

   Attribute Grammar 1 (AG 1)   note: this grammar is recursive
   =========================
    type - an attribute to store the data type of variables or expressions
    lookup (<var>.id) returns the variable's type from the symbol table 

    <assign> ::= <var> = <expr> 
    PREDICATE: <var>.type == <expr>.type
    
    <expr> ::= <var> + <expr>[2] 
    Semantic Rule #1: if (<expr>[2] == REAL or <var> == REAL)
                           <expr>.type <- REAL 
                       else
                           <expr>.type <- INT 

    <expr> ::= <var>
    Semantic Rule #2: <expr>.type <- <var>.type

    <var> -> A | B | C | D
    Semantic Rule #3: <var>.type <- lookup (<var>.id)

30. AG1 employs 
    A. inheritance     B. synthesis     C. both
<!-- 30. ANS: B --!>
