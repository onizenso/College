<pre>
  Without exception handling
        When an exception occurs, control goes to OS (a crash) or program 
        freezes (hang)
  
  With exception handling
       Programmer can trap exceptions, prevent crashes and freezes and control 
       what happens next

Basic Concepts
   Many languages allow programs to trap input/output errors (including EOF)

   An exception is any unusual event, either erroneous or not, detectable by 
   either hardware or software, that may cause a crash or freeze if not
   otherwise handled
 
   Most common Examples: divide by zero, illegal memory access (dereferencing
   a bad pointer, array out-of-bounds), file open errors, input errors (reading
   float into char), reading past EOF    

   Processing the exception is called *exception handling*
    
   An exception is *raised* when its associated event occurs
  
   The exception handling code unit is called an *exception handler*

User-defined Exception Handling 
    A language that does not have exception handling built-in can still 
    define, detect, raise, and handle exceptions 

    Pass an argument (flag or error msg) to an error-handling routing
    or return a flag (boolean, int)

    Have some mechanism for interpreting what the return flag means (see
    Unix strcmp)

    Give exception handling utilities global scope 

****************************************************
* Advantages of Built-in Exception Handling in C++ *
****************************************************

   Added to C++ in 1990 (Design based on CLU, Ada, and ML)

   Code reusability, uniformity, promotes readability

   Error detection code is tedious to write and clutters the program

   Allows you to rethrow back to main, unwind the runtime stack and perform
   cleanup (very difficult to code otherwise)

   Saves the return value for something other than error handling

   Supports dynamic memory management if objects are allocated in a try block
   since destructors are called upon exiting the block

   Increases chances that a program can recover without a complete crash

*******************************************************************
* Things you should know about exception handling in any language *
*******************************************************************

   How is an exception occurrence bound to an exception handler?
   How and where are exception handlers specified and what is their scope?
   Are there any built-in exceptions?
   Are default exception handlers used if exception handling is not explicitly
   coded? 
   Can built-in exceptions be explicitly raised?
   Are hardware-detectable errors treated as exceptions that can be handled?
   How can exceptions be disabled, if at all?   
   How does exception handling control flow work?
   Where does execution continue, if at all, after an exception handler 
   completes its execution?

*****************************
* Exception Handling in C++ *
*****************************
Basic syntax:

  try {
    throw  
  }
  catch (formal parameter) {
     throw    // optional re-throw will propogate through runtime state
  }
  catch (...) { // a generic handler
  }

Specific example:
  
  const int DivideByZero = 10;
  //....
  double divide(double x, double y) {
      if(y==0) throw DivideByZero;
      return x/y;
  }
  ///...
  try {
     divide(10, 0);
  }
  catch(int i) {
    if (i==DivideByZero) cerr << "Divide by zero error";
  }
  
  
  
// example of error objects
  
  class DivideByZero
  {
      public:
          double divisor;
          DivideByZero(double x);
  };
  DivideByZero::DivideByZero(double x) : divisor(x)
  {}
  int divide(int x, int y)
  {
      if(y==0)
      {
          throw DivideByZero(x);
      }
  }
  try
  {
      divide(12, 0);
  }
  catch (DivideByZero divZero)
  {
      cerr<<"Attempted to divide "<<divZero.divisor<<" by zero";
  }


Notes on C++ facility:

o  catch function is overloaded--formal parameter of each catch must be unique
   The formal parameter need not have a variable
   It can be simply a type name to distinguish the handler it is in from others
   The formal parameter can be used to transfer information to the handler
   If formal parameter is an ellipsis it handles all exceptions not yet handled

o A throw without an operand can only appear in a catch block; when it appears,
  it re-throws the exception to the next available handler by unwinding the
  runtime stack

o An unhandled exception is thrown to every function on the runtime stack until
  it is finally thrown to main; if no handler is found in main the program 
  terminates with an error message (not good)

o After a handler completes its execution, control flows to the first statement 
  after the last handler in the sequence of handlers of which it is an element

o  Exceptions are not named; hardware and system software-detectable exceptions 
   cannot be handled

o  Exceptions are bound to handlers through the type of the parameter 
   (does not promote readability)
