<b>A SUBPROGRAM...</b>

o  is also called a subroutine, a function, a procedure, a method
o  is a collection of statements that can be reused - thus a process 
   abstraction (data abstraction began later)
o  has a single entry point
o  suspends execution of the calling program during execution of the called 
   subprogram 
o  returns control to caller when the called subprogram terminates
o  includes a mechanism to pass parameters for parameterized computations and 
   to return a value
o  that is semantically modeled on a mathematical function should only return 
   a value and not produce side effects (i.e. functional languages) 
 
<b>SUBPROGRAM TERMINOLOGY</b>

A <u>subprogram definition</u> describes the interface to and the actions 
of the subprogram abstraction

A <u>subprogram call</u> is an explicit request that the subprogram be 
executed

A <u>subprogram header</u> is the first part of the definition, includes 
name, type of subprogram, and formal parameters

The <u>parameter profile</u> (aka signature) of a subprogram is the number, 
order, and types of its parameters

The <u>protocol</u> is a subprogram's parameter profile and, if it is a 
function, its return type  

A <u>subprogram declaration (or prototype)</u> provides the protocol, but not 
the body, of the subprogram 

A <u>formal parameter</u> is a dummy variable listed in the subprogram 
header and used in the subprogram

An <u>actual parameter</u> (also called argument) represents a value or 
address used in the subprogram call statement 

<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color: #AAAAAA; padding: 5%;">
    /* Actual to Formal Parameter Correspondence */
    int test ( int num ) {    <== formal/dummy parameter
       return num++;
    }
    int my_num = 5;
    test(my_num);             <= actual parameter 

</div>
<u>Positional binding</u> is the binding of actual parameters to formal 
parameters by position: the first actual parameter is bound to the first 
formal parameter and so forth (safe and effective); C/C++/Java do this.

<u>Keyword binding</u> occurs when the name of the formal parameter to which 
an actual parameter is to be bound is specified with the actual parameter
 - parameters can appear in any order - <a href="http://www.cs.csub.edu/~donna/cs350/Code/Python/functions.py">(see Python)</a>

<u>Formal Parameter Default Values</u>
In certain languages (e.g., C++, Ada), formal parameters can have default 
values (if not actual parameter is passed)
In C++, default parameters must appear last because parameters are 
positionally associated (<a href="./Code/C++/Polymorphism/circle.h">ex. C++</a>)

<u>Variable Number of Parameters</u>
<a href="./Code/Python/functions.py">Python</a> supports variable length parameter lists through *name syntax;
C# methods can accept a variable number of parameters as long as they are 
of the same type

<b>DESIGN ISSUES</b>

o  What parameter passing methods are provided? (in C pass-by-value only)
o  Are parameter types checked?  (in C yes but in Perl no)
o  Are local variables static or dynamic?  (in C dynamic by default)
o  Can subprograms be nested?   (not in ANSI C but yes in GNU C)
o  Are subprograms treated as first class objects?  (not in C but yes in Python)
o  Can subprograms be overloaded?  (not in C but yes in C++)
o  Can subprogram be generic?   (C++ templates)

<hr>
<b>LOCAL REFERENCING ENVIRONMENTS</b>

<u>stack-dynamic local variables</u> 
o this is the default practice
o variables are bound/unbound to storage at runtime
o supports recursion
o storage for locals is shared among some subprograms
o run-time overhead of allocation/de-allocation and initialization 
o indirect addressing (inefficient and security problems) 
o subprograms cannot be history sensitive

<u>static local variables</u>
o variables are bound/unbound to storage at compile time 
o more efficient (no indirection): <a href="./Code/C/timing.c">see timing.c</a>
o no run-time overhead
o cannot support recursion

<hr>
<b>FIVE PARAMETER PASSING METHODS</b>

The three semantic modes (in mode, out mode and inout mode) are implemented
by one of the following 5 mechanisms.
<SPAN STYLE="Background-Color : yellow">
<u>Pass-by-Value (In Mode)</u>
</SPAN>
o semantics: pass a value in; do not change it within the function or in caller
o The R-value of the actual parameter is copied to the R-value of the formal
  parameter
o copying requires additional storage and copy operation (can be costly) 
o All parameters in C and Java are pass-by-value ("pass by reference" is
  really passing a reference or pointer by value) (<a href="./Code/Java/Functions.java">see Java code</a>)

<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color: #AAAAAA">
    // use of const to enforce In Mode parameter passing semantics
    test(const int formal) {         
       int result = 100/formal; 
       formal = formal + 1;   <= compilation error
    } 
    int actual = 5;
    test(actual);  // the R-value of actual is copied to R-value of formal       
</div>
<SPAN STYLE="Background-Color : yellow">
<u>Pass-by-Value-Result (Inout Mode)</u> (also called pass-by-copy)
</SPAN>
o pass the value coming in and pass the value out upon exit (two copies)
o On call, r-values of actuals are passed and copied to r-values of formals 
o On return, r-values of formals are copied back to r-values of actuals 
o has the disadvantage of pass-by-value  (copying cost)
o advantage over pass-by-reference is no dereferencing

   This mechanism is implemented in Fortran. 

<SPAN STYLE="Background-Color : yellow">
<u>Pass-by-Reference (Inout Mode)</u> (also called pass-by-sharing)
</SPAN>
o the l-value of the actual parameter is assigned to the l-value of the actual 
  parameter 
o the semantics supports an assignment statement in the callee that modifies
  the value in the calling routine

<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color: #AAAAAA">
  // demonstrate the difference between C++ pass-by-ref and 
  // C pass-by-value pointer 
  void foo(int & x){
     x = 5;   <== C++ modifies actual parameter 
  }
  void foo (int * x)
  {
     x = 0;   <== C does NOT modify actual parameter 
  }
</div>
o Passing process is efficient (no copying or duplicated storage)
o more secure than the use of pointers - cannot modify the pointer address
o <a href="./Code/C++/functions.cpp">see C++ code </a> with reference type (&)

Disadvantages:
o potentials for un-wanted side effects (as with any out mode parameter)
o un-wanted aliases (access broadened)

<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color: #AAAAAA">
// demonstrate pass by reference in C# with keyword 'ref' (<a href="./Code/C_sharp/sample6.cs">see code</a>)
   void Foo (ref int x) 
   {
      x = 0;   // will modify y in calling routine  
   }
   ...

   int y=5; 
   Foo (ref y);
   Console.WriteLine ("{0} \n",y);   // will print 0

</div>
<SPAN STYLE="Background-Color : yellow">
<u>Pass-by-Result (Out Mode)</u>
</spaN>
o no value is transmitted to subprogram
o the corresponding formal parameter must be an L-value; its value is 
  transmitted to caller's actual parameter upon return
o cannot be accessed until AFTER subprogram call 
o if implemented by copy rather than access path (typically is) requires
  extra storage and copy operation

<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color: #AAAAAA">
// demonstrate pass-by-result in C# with 'out' keyword (<a href="./Code/C_sharp/sample6.cs">see code</a>)

  void Foo (out int x)
  {

    // int a = x; <== compilation error if try to read x here 
    x = 10;  // assignment must occur for method to complete normally
    int a = x; // The value of x can be read now
  }

  int y;   // declare a variable with no value assigned to it 
  Foo (out y);   // pass y in as an output parameter
  Console.WriteLine (y);  // prints 10 

</div>

Semantic Difficulties:
 Passing the same L-value to more than one result parameter:
 sub(p1, p1); // what is the current value of p1?

 Potential problem: evaluation time of actual parameters can impact result;
 if list[index] is passed in and index changed in the subroutine (as global
 or pass by result), the address of list[index] will differ between call
 and return. 

<SPAN STYLE="Background-Color : yellow">
<u>Pass-by-Name (Inout Mode)</u>
</SPAN>
o Formals are bound to an access method at the time of the call, but actual 
  binding to a value or address takes place at the time of a reference or 
  assignment at runtime
o Allows flexibility in late binding
o Used by Algo 60, Miranda, Haskell
   
<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color: #AAAAAA">
// demonstrate pass-by-name for virtual functions (polymorphism) in C++:
  Circle c;         // Circle is a Shape  
  test(c);          
  void test ( Shape & s ){  
      s.update();  // late binding of s.update() to Circle c object 
  }
  
</div>
<b>IMPLEMENTING PARAMETER-PASSING METHODS</b>

o In most languages, parameter communication takes place thru run-time stack

o Pass-by-reference is the simplest to implement; only an address is placed 
  in the stack

o A subtle but fatal error can occur with pass-by-reference and 
  pass-by-value-result: a formal parameter corresponding to a constant can 
  mistakenly be changed

o The security of pass-by-value is eliminated when the value passed is a
  pointer (<a href="./Code/C/functions.c">see C code</a>)

<u>Parameter Passing Methods of Major Languages</u>
o Fortran
  Always used the Inout semantics model
  Before Fortran 77: pass-by-reference
  Fortran 77 and later: scalar variables are often passed by value-result

o C
  Everything is pass-by-value
  Pass-by-reference is "simulated" by passing a pointer by value

o C++
  pass-by-value, pass-by-reference, pass-by-name <a href="./Code/C++/functions.cpp">(see code)</a> 

o Java
  Everything is pass-by-value (<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/javaOO/arguments.html">see docs</a>)
  For object parameters, a reference is passed by value (see Java docs) in the
  same way that C passes pointers - except programmer has no access to the
  pointer <a href="./Code/Java/Functions.java">(see code)</a>

o Ada
  Three semantics modes of parameter transmission: IN, OUT, IN OUT; 
  IN is the default mode
  Formal parameters declared out can be assigned but not referenced; those 
  declared in can be referenced but not assigned; in out parameters can be 
  referenced and assigned <a href="./Code/Ada/hw09.adb">(see code)</a> <br>

o C#
  Default method: pass-by-value
  Pass-by-reference is specified by preceding both a formal parameter and 
  its actual parameter with 'ref'
  Pass-by-result is specified by preceding both a formal parameter and 
  its actual parameter with 'out' 
  <a href="./Code/C_sharp/sample6.cs">(see code)</a>

o PHP: 
  Default method: pass-by-value
  Use & to <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php">pass by ref</a> ; more examples of <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php">parameter passing</a>

o Perl: all actual parameters are implicitly placed in a predefined array 
  named @_  <a href="./Code/Perl/test.pl">(see code)</a> 

o Python:
  A parameter reference (address) is passed by value (like C and Java); 
  immutable objects in the caller cannot be changed in the callee but 
  mutable objects (lists for example) can be changed in the callee.
  see <a href="./Code/Python/functions.py">functions.py</a> for examples. 

  The author of Python (Guido van Rossum) calls this parameter passing scheme 
  "call by object reference." (<a href="./Code/Python/functions.py">see code</a>):

<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color:#AAAAAA;">
  def one():
     x = 1            # a scalar is immutable
     two(x)      
     print "x:" x    
     alist = [0,1]
     three(alist)
     print "alist: " alist

  def two(y):     
     y = 2

  def three(blist):   # binds blist to alist  
     blist.append(2)  # a list is mutable so blist and alist become [0,1,2]
     blist = []       # binds blist to a null list but alist is not changed 
 
  one()               # prints  x: 1    alist: [0,1,2]
</div>

<hr>
<b>TYPE CHECKING PARAMETERS</b>

o Considered essential for reliability
o FORTRAN 77 and original C: none
  Pascal, FORTRAN 90, Java, and Ada: it is always required
  ANSI C and C++: choice is made by the user via function prototypes
  Relatively new languages Perl, JavaScript, and PHP do not require type 
  checking <a href="./Code/PHP/functions.txt">(see code)</a>

<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color:#AAAAAA;">
      &lt;?php
      $num = 5;
      Test($num,"hello");
      Test("hello",$num);

      function test( $first, $second) {
          echo "$first and $second &lt;br>";
      }
      ?>
</div>
 Parametric Polymorphism refers to languages that generally enforce
 parameter type checking and yet also support shift-changing of types
 at runtime. This ability is part of a wider concept known as
 generic programming.
 <p>
 Ada (static, strongly typed) and C++ (static, somewhat strongly typed) 
 both support Parametric Polymorphism. In Ada it is through  the
 keyword 'generic' applied to types, subscript ranges, and constant values.
 In C++ it is through inheritance and
 the keyword 'virtual' applied to base class
 methods.
<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color:#AAAAAA;">
  generic
  type element is private;
  type Index is (<>);
  type Vector is array (Index) of Element;
  procedure Generic_Sort (List) : in out Vector ) is
     Temp : Element;
     Lower_Bound : List'First;
     Upper_Bound : List'Range;
     Index_1: List'Range;
     Index_2 : List'Range;
     Outer_limit : List'Range;
     Inner_Begin : List'Range;
     begin
     Outer_Limit : Upper_Bound - 1;
     for Index_1 in Lower_Bound .. Outer_Limit loop
         Inner_Begin := Index_1 + 1;
        for Index_2 in Inner_Begin .. Upper_Bound loop
            if List(Index_1) > List(Index>2) then
                temp := List(Index_1);
                List(Index_1) := List(Index_2);
                List (Index_2) := Temp;
            end if;
        end loop; -- for Index_1
      end Loop; -- for Index_2
  end Generic_Sort; 

</div>

<b>MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS AS PARAMETERS</b>
    
If a multidimensional array is passed to a subprogram, the compiler needs 
the declared size of that array to build the storage mapping function

In languages where n-dimen arrays are implemented as a single dimension, 
such as C and C++, the declared sizes of all but the first subscript must 
be included in the actual parameter. WHY? (<a href="./Code/C/arrays.c">see C code</a>) 

Makes subprograms inflexible

Solution: pass a pointer to the array and the sizes of the dimensions as 
other parameters; the user must include the storage mapping function in 
terms of the size parameters

Java and C#
 o Arrays are objects; they are all single-dimensioned, but the elements can 
   be arrays
 o Each array inherits a named constant (length in Java, Length in C#) that 
   is set to the length of the array when the array object is created

PHP  
  o all arrays (indexed or associative) are internally stored as associative 
<hr>
<b>Design Considerations for Parameter Passing </b>

A tradeoff between efficiency (two-way) and security (one-way)

Security demands limited access to variables, which means one-way 
whenever possible

Pass-by-reference is more efficient than any other method - no dereferencing
to acquire memory address; const & is the safest and most efficient. 
   
<hr>
<b>SUBPROGRAMS PASSED AS PARAMETERS </B>

o Are parameter types checked?

o What is the correct referencing environment for the subprogram?

In C/C++, a function can be passed as a parameter by passing a
  pointer to the function; functions as parameters are type checked (<a href="./Code/C/Semaphores/main.c"> see C code </a> )

PHP has some built-in support for passing functions in functions <a href="./Code/PHP/functions.txt">(see code)</a>  
 <a href="./Code/PHP/functions.php">RunIt</a>

In Python functions are treated like first-class objects (no differently than
data); functions can be passed to a function like any other type 
parameters are not checked (<a href="./Code/Python/functions.py">see code</a>)
<hr>
<b>NESTED SUBPROGRAMS PASSED AS PARAMETERS</b>

ANSI C/C++ do not support nested subprograms. Ada, GNU gcc, and JavaScript do.

Referencing Environment for Nested Subprograms 

<u>Shallow binding:</u> The environment of the call statement that enacts the 
passed subprogram (applicable to languages that use dynamic scoping)

<u>Deep binding:</u> The environment of the definition of the passed subprogram
(applicable to languages that use static scoping)

<u>Ad hoc binding:</u> The environment of the call statement that passed the 
subprogram 

<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color:#AAAAAA;">
// JavaScript Example 
// What is the referencing environment of sub2?

function sub1(){
    var x = 1;
    function sub2(){   //x=1 if static environment of function definition
      alert(x);
    };
    function sub3(){
      var x = 2;
      sub4(sub2);     //x=2 if static environment of the call statement  
    };
    function sub4(subx){
        var x = 3;
        subx();      //x=3 if dynamic environment of function execution
    }
    sub3();
};

</div>
<SCRIPT>
function sub1(){
    var x = 1;
    function sub2(){ 
      alert(x);
    };
    function sub3(){
      var x = 2;
      sub4(sub2);    
    };
    function sub4(subx){
        var x = 3;
        subx();    
    }
    sub3();
};
</SCRIPT>
<form>
<input type="button" value="Execute sub1( )"  bgcolor="yellow"
           onClick="sub1(); return false;"> 
</form>
<hr>
<b>OVERLOADED SUBPROGRAMS</B>

An overloaded subprogram is one that has the same name as another 
subprogram in the same referencing environment

Every version of an overloaded subprogram has a unique protocol

C++, Java, C#, and Ada include predefined overloaded subprograms 

In Ada, the return type of an overloaded function can be used to 
disambiguate calls (thus two overloaded functions can have the same 
parameters)

Ada, Java, C++, and C# allow users to write multiple versions of 
subprograms with the same name (e.g. name mangling) <a href="./Code/C++/date.h">(see code)</a>

PHP does not support function overloading, nor is it possible to undefine 
or redefine previously-declared functions.
<hr>
<B>GENERIC SUBPROGRAMS</B>

A generic or polymorphic subprogram takes parameters of different types on 
different activations

Overloaded subprograms provide ad hoc polymorphism

A subprogram that takes a generic parameter that is used in a type 
expression that describes the type of the parameters of the subprogram 
provides parametric polymorphism

Examples of parametric polymorphism: C++

    template &lt;class Type>
    Type max(Type first, Type second) {
        return first > second ? first : second;
    }
    
    The above template can be instantiated for any type for which operator > 
    is defined
    
    int max (int first, int second) {
    return (first > second) ? first : second;
    }
   
<hr>
<B> DESIGN ISSUES FOR FUNCTIONS</B>

o Are side effects allowed? 
o Parameters should always be in-mode to reduce side effect (like Ada)
o What types of return values are allowed? 
  - most imperative languages restrict the return types
  - C allows any type except arrays and functions
  - C++ is like C but also allows user-defined types
  - Ada allows any type
  - Java and C# do not have functions but methods can have any type

<hr>
<B>USER-DEFINED OVERLOADED OPERATORS</B>

Operators can be overloaded in Ada and C++

An Ada example to overload * to support vectors (can also do this in C++):

    Function R*S(A,B: in Vec_Type): return Integer is
      Sum: Integer := 0;
      begin
         for Index in A <== range loop
             Sum := Sum + A(Index) * B(Index)
         end loop
      return sum;
    end R*S;
    
    c = a * b; <== where a, b, and c are of type Vec_Type

<hr>
<b>COROUTINES</b>

(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine">see wiki</a>)

Threads involve simultaneous execution and coroutines involve interleaved 
execution

Threads are designed to solve complex and processor intensive problems

Coroutines solve problems in which there is a symmetric relationship
between two subroutines

In coroutines the caller and called coroutines are on a more equal basis

A traditional subroutine has one entry (the call) and one exit (the return)

In coroutines there may be multiple entries and exits (a subroutine is a 
special case of coroutine)

Coroutines may repeatedly resume each other forever

The first time a coroutine is invoked, execution starts at the beginning of the
coroutine; each subsequent time a coroutine is invoked, execution resumes 
following the place where the coroutine last returned (yielded).

A coroutine can return multiple times, making it possible to return additional 
values upon subsequent calls to the coroutine. Coroutines in which subsequent 
calls yield additional results are often known as generators.


Subroutines require a single stack preallocated at the beginning of program 
execution

Coroutines are best implemented using continuations on additional stacks
(languages with automatic garbage collection are best for this reason) 

Example (note that two threads are not required to do this):

<div style="border:1px dashed; background-color:#AAAAAA;">
var q := new queue

coroutine produce
    loop
        while q is not full
            create some new items
            add the items to q
        yield to consume

coroutine consume
    loop
        while q is not empty
            remove some items from q
            use the items
        yield to produce

</div>
   
<a href="./Code/Python/generators.py">Python generators</a> 
* Python generators are close to coroutines
<a href="./Code/Python/coroutines.py">Python coroutines</a> 
* Python 2.5 supports coroutines
