<b>Background.</b><br>
 JavaScript is a client-side scripting language for the web.
  That means that the code is executed by a JavaScript engine integrated
  into the client browser. All current browsers
 support JavaScript, although not all are compliant to the same standard. 
 For this lab and for the exam, you need only test your code
 under Mozilla Firefox.
 <p>   
  JavaScript is not "baby-Java." 
The only relationship between Java and
 JavaScript is that both are object-oriented languages and both
 share C-style control structures and operators.
 That is about where the similarity ends. 
 The choice of name is unfortunate. JavaScript was
 created by Netscape and the name is a trademark of Sun.
 <p> 
 Client-side scripts are generally triggered  by events
 that occur when the user interacts with the client browser, often
  through FORM elements. 
 Since JavaScript is client-side, there are far more 
 ways to interact with the user in JavaScript than there are with PHP.
 You also have more control over writing to the current page in
 JavaScript. Click these buttons for a demonstration:<p>

<INPUT TYPE="button" value="Write It" 
   onClick="area=document.getElementById('myArea'); area.innerHTML=
'<H3>You cannot do this in PHP</h3><font color=red>but you can in JavaScript</font><p>'; 
return false;">
<INPUT TYPE="button" value="Clear It" 
       onClick="area=document.getElementById('myArea');
                area.innerHTML='';
                return false;">
<p>
<!-- create an area on the document that you can write to -->

<DIV id="myArea">
</DIV>

 Server-side script languages, like PHP, provide control over things that happen behind
 the scenes on the server and things that occur over the long 
 term (not just when the user
 is viewing the page). PHP is good for logging information, controlling
 user access, and anything involving processes on the server (a mailer for
 example). JavaScript is
 good for things that occur only during the time the user is on the page.
 <p>
 The focus of this lab is the event-handling aspects of JavaScript, where
 user activity is tied to elements in the HTML <a href="http://www.cs.csub.edu/~donna/cs211/Material/DOM.gif">document tree</a>. Objects in the tree
 are linked to <a href="http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6408-10/handlers.htm">events and event handlers</a>. Although
 a JavaScript can be in a standalone file, in this
 lab  you will embed your scripts into an HTML file (lab07.html).
 Since JavaScript is client-side, you can write lab07.html on your
 local PC and load it onto a web server when you are finished (if you want). 
 Otherwise, modify lab07.html directly from within /public_html
 in your  account on
 sleipnir.
<p>
 The debugging capabilities of the JavaScript interpreter are browser
 dependent. If you use Netscape,
  Mozilla or Firefox, you will either type 'javascript:' in the URL bar
 or open the Tools->Error Console from the menu (depending on the version).
  Any errors in your script will be
 displayed in the console window.  All versions of Mozilla Firefox after 3
  use the Tools->Error Console from the menu bar. You 
 can also install a Firefox extension called <a href="http://getfirebug.com">firebug</a>.
<p>
You will need to know a little HTML for this lab, as well as the basics of how
 embedding Javascript into HTML works. If you do not know any HTML,
 read this <a href="/~donna/ls290/basic_html.html">basic guide</a>. 
Create a 'lab07' directory under your $HOME/public_html. 
 (Keep the default permissions since all directories 
 you want accessible on the Internet must have 
 755 permission and files must have 744.) Copy events.html into 
  $HOME/public_html/lab07/:
<pre>
    cp  /home/fac/donna/public_html/cs350/Code/JavaScript/events.html .
</pre>


 (To make the existing code in events.html work with minimal modification,
   you may want to create an Images subdirectory 
  to hold your images for this lab.)
 <p>
View the source of events.html while looking at the
 behavior in your browser: <a href="./Code/JavaScript/events.html">events.html</a>. Everything you need to complete this lab is in the documentation
 in events.html.
<p>
<b>WHAT TO DO FIRST</b><p>
<p><ol>
<li>Make a backup of events.html for reference in case you need it.
  For the first few items, you will insert
 code into the opening script in events.html. The remaining items
 involve putting JavaScript into event handlers.
 <p>
<li>
 Download your own 
 images for each of the image references
 in events.html. If you are in Rm 315, download the images
  onto the Desktop. To get the files onto sleipnir, open a terminal and do 
  this:<pre>
 cd Desktop 
 ftp sleipnir // login as you
 ftp> mput *.jpg prompt  // will transfer all jpg images to your home directory
 ftp> quit
 
 Move the images from $HOME to your /public_html/Images subdirectory.
</pre> 
 Alternatively, grab an image directly
 from the command line on sleipnir:
<pre>
   $ wget http://www.anywhere.com/some_image.jpg   // will grab some_image.jpg
</pre> 
<p> 
<li> Open events.html in vim.
 </ol>
 <p>
<b>PROBLEM #1</b><p>
<ol>
<li>Following the syntax in the code below, 
 create an array to hold four background images 
 in the opening script: <pre>
var myArray = [];  // this array will grow as needed
myArray[0] = new Image();
myArray[1] = new Image();
 and so on...
</pre>
<li>Assign the src attribute
  of each image object to one of your image filenames following this code:
<pre>
   myArray[0].src = "some_image.jpg";
  and so on.... 
</pre>
 <li>Modify the event handler
 that changes the background image of the body of 
 the document to toggle through your array of background images.
</ol>
 <p>
<b>PROBLEM #2</b><p>
<ol>
<li>Create an array to hold 4 or five different hex color codes
 This code should also be in the opening script.
  Assign each element in the array a different hex color code; e.g.: "#AABBCC".
<p>
<li> Modify the event handler
 that changes the background color of the upper DIV area, 
 toggle through your array of hex color codes.
 </ol>
<p>
<b>PROBLEM #3</b><p>
<ol>
<li>In the lower DIV area, add an onClick event to one
 of the images to prompt the user 
 for a hex color code:<pre> 
     prompt('enter hex code: ','#FFFFFF');   // #FFFFFF is the default value
 </pre> 
 Change the DIV area background to that color.
 <p>
 <li> Modify the text on the page so I know which image to click.
</ol>
<p>

<b>PROBLEM #4</b><p>
<ol>
<li> Create a display() function to write your name in
  the DIV area labeled myArea - an empty function named 
 display() is already there.
<p>
 <li>In the lower DIV area, add an onClick event in one of the images that
 doesn't have one  to call display().
<p>
</ol>
That's it.
