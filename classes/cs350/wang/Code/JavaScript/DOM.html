DOM:<p> 
<font size=2>
Short for Document Object Model, DOM is the specification for how objects 
in a Web page (text, images, headers, links, etc.) are represented. The DOM defines 
what attributes are associated with each object, and how the objects and 
attributes can be manipulated. The DOM is the application programming interface (API) between the page and the programming language (be it JavaScript or something else). Any language relies on the client browser's specification of the DOM. 
<P>
Unfortunately, the two leading browsers -- Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
Internet Explorer -- use different DOMs. This is one reason why their 
respective implementations of DHTML are so different. Both companies have 
submitted their DOMs to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for 
standardization, which now has the daunting task of specifying a standard 
DOM without alienating either of the browser giants. The W3C's DOM 
 latest specification  looks very different than Netscape's original
 DOM.
<P>
Netscape's DOM which closely matches the W3C specification 1 and is (for the most part) supported by IE. Thus, the browser engine 
of Netscape and Microsoft will automatically create a set of objects based 
on the content of your HTML documents that follows this format:
