<h3>How C# is Different from C++</h3>
Note: some of the differences below have changed - see the
 latest docs:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yyaad03b%28v=vs.71%29.aspx">MSDN</a> 
<p>
A brief overview:
<pre>
MAJOR FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES
   * entry point is a method called Main inside a class (must be uppercase) 
   * no class-less functions
   * default parameter passing mechanism is by value (IN mode); keywords ref 
     and out support INOUT and OUT parameter passing modes
   * automatic garbage collection
   * introduces properties
   * introduces interfaces (like an abstract class but more general)
   * support for lambda (anonymous) functions 
   * .NET-Framework library (STL in C++ is not as extensive)
   * advanced runtime type information and reflection
   * built-in support for threads
   * attributes can be attached to classes and retrieved at runtime
   * built-in networking support (can open a socket)
   * support for metadata (maintaining data about your data) 
   * support for reflection

CONTROL STRUCTURE DIFFERENCES
   * supports iteration on data structure (foreach construct)
   * no deterministic order of calls to destructors
   * support for static constructors (executed before any instance of the class)
   * supports constructor-chaining (one constructor can call another 
     constructor from the same class - try doing this in C++)


DATA TYPE DIFFERENCES
   * everything derives from Object or can be treated as if
   * all arrays are heap dynamic objects 
   * arithmetic operations can be checked for overflow if required
   * introduces value types and reference types (the value of a value type 
     exists on the stack - the value of a reference type exists in the heap)
   * by default all classes are reference types and all scalars and simple
     structs are value types
   * UTF/16 encoding for strings
   * no bitfields
   * supports jagged arrays (array of arrays)
   * stronger typed - no implicit narrowing coercions
   * type bool and keywords true and false - no coercion from arithmetic 
     expression to type bool in conditions; e.g no more (x=5) errors
   * everything must be initialized before being used
   * no pointers except in unsafe mode
   * structs and classes are different (structs are classes in C with all
     public members, structs are value types in C#)
   * all types have a defined size (e.g. a long is 64Bit on all platforms)

MINOR SYNTACTIC DIFFERENCES
   * Main must be uppercase
   * no semicolon after a class declaration 
   * 'using' replaces header files and #include statements
   * no fall-through on switch-statements
   * no forward declarations required, classes can be arranged at will
   * access to class members is with dot operator only (no -> or ::)
   * conditional functions (e.g. for debugging)
   * 'readonly' is the keyword instead of const
   * no multiple inheritance
   * no global variables, functions, constants
   * no default arguments on function parameters

EXCEPTION HANDLIING
   * no user-defined exception classes - must be derived from System.Exception 
   * there is a 'finally' block for exceptions
   * implicit exception handling on input
   * implicit array bounds checking
