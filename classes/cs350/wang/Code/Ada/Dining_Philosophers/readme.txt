This project demonstrates a very important aspect of Ada - strong
support for modularization and encapsulation. test_dining_philosophers.ada
relies on packages from the components_3_3.tar file. The structure of Ada 
allows programs to be safely and easily broken up into modules, thus multiple 
coders can work on a large project.
