 CMPS 223 with a grade of C- or better<p>

<b>Description:</b>
</font>
<br>This course is an introduction to the history, models and underlying
 concepts of programming languages. Students will  learn
 to categorize and evaluate languages and determine why one language is 
 better suited to a particular problem or need. A comprehensive range of 
 programming paradigms (procedural, object oriented, 
 functional, declarative, and scripting) will be covered. 
 Specific topics will include formal grammars, typing, scope, recursion, 
 procedures invocation, context, binding, and the mechanisms that
  support control flow and
  modularization. Labs consist of hands-on programming problems and will
 cover a wide-range of languages.

<p><b>Texts:</b>
</font>
<br>Required: <i>Concepts of Programming Languages</i> by Robert Sebesta
7th Edition ISBN 0-321-33025-0 OR 8th Edition ISBN-10: 0-321-49362-1
<p>
<br>Recommended: <i>C A Reference Manual</i> by Harbison and Steele 4/E
 ISBN: 0-13-326224-3


<p><b>General Information:</b>
</font><br>
 You are expected to be proficient in C++ and the 
 Unix programming environment. 
 All programming will be done under Unix. 
 If you do not know Unix but know C++,
 you should take the 1-unit course "Introduction to Unix" 
 course offered during the first week of each quarter. You will need to
 spend extra time during the first week to catch up. 
<p>
 Lectures follow the assigned reading topics
 in the text and provide additional or more detailed information.
 Labs consist of programming assignments in languages you most likely
 have not used. Exams are taken during normal class hours on 
 scheduled Fridays.
<p>
 Your lowest two homework/lab grades are dropped. The lowest coding
  exam score may, in some cases, be dropped. Late lab/homework are not accepted. 
 Homeworks consist of multiple choice quizzes that are taken
 online and submitted to me online. You must submit the quiz on time
 and 90% correct for credit.

 <p>
 You must do your own coding.
 Refer to the Department's policy on <a href="http://www.cs.csubak.edu/newsite/index.php?t=1&p=academic_info/academic_honesty/index">academic honesty</a> if you have any questions.
<p>
There are two midterm exams and one comprehensive final. The midterm exams
 consist of two parts, each worth 50%. The written component (closed book)
 is 
 randomly selected questions from the homeworks, with minor variations.
 The coding component is coding exercises you complete
 during the lab period on the computer. 
  See the calendar for the languages
 you will need to code in.
 You may use all online resources at your disposal to
 write the code. For Winter 2011:
 If you received 90% or less on the lisp coding exam, you can drop the lower
 of your two coding exam grades to compute your grade. The lowest written
 exam grade is not dropped. 
 <p>
 The final is a written exam only, with questions taken from both midterms
 and the remaining homeworks 
  that were not covered on the last midterm.
