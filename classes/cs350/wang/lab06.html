<h3>ADA</h3>

 Ada was developed primarily as a language for real-time embedded systems
  (reliability and concurrency are important in this domain). 
 Ada is still the number one 
 software in avionics.
  You might be interested in reading about <a href="http://gcn.com/Articles/2008/04/11/The-return-of-Ada.aspx?Page=3&p=1">The Return of Ada</a>.
 <p>
 
This article on <a href="http://www.adahome.com/articles/1997-03/ada_vs_cpp.html">Ada vs C++</a> introduces Ada in terms of things you know.<p>
<p>
 For file I/O, read this tutorial on
 <a href="http://www.infres.enst.fr/~pautet/Ada95/chap14.htm">Ada I/O</a>.
 (The other Ada tutorials are also very good.)
<p>

 Everything you need to know for this lab is
  in <a href="./Code/Ada/test.adb">test.adb</a>.
 <p>

 Your job is to write an Ada program that performs matrix multiplication.
 Use a program of at least two procedures (any way you want to do it).
  If you manage your scoping, you don't need to pass parameters to your
 procedure. You can pass parameters if you want - test.adb demonstrates
 how to do that.
 <p>
 Declare two arrays of size 3 by 5 of integers.
 Load the arrays from an external text file of random
 integers.
 Design your matrix ADT to enforce all range constraints (index ranges and
 value ranges). Make both ranges
 large enough to run the program without raising an exception. So if
 the value range of your input numbers is 1..300, then the value
  range of the integers 
 in your result matrix must include larger values since you do multiplication. 
  (If you use type INTEGER then you are OK - you should try a sub-range to
 get a feel for what you can do in Ada).
 <p>
  Assume filename 'lab06.in' and
  this format (15 integers per line):
 </p>
<pre>
 1  3 8 4 10 2  4  38 43 4 8 12 32 16 6
 23 8 9 9 18 41 11 21 12 2 1 6  33 11 22
</pre>
 Multiply the two matrices and store the values in a third matrix. Perform
 matrix multiplication as: <pre>
 a(1,1)*b(1,1)=c(1,1)
 a(1,2)*b(1,2)=c(1,2)
 a(1,3)*b(1,3)=c(1,3)
      ...
 a(3,5)*b(3,5)=c(3,5)
</pre>
	 Finally, 
 write the contents of matrix 3 to an output
 file 'lab06.out'.
