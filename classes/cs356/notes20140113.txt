Inference Engine - contains rules for forward/backward chaining
	Conflict Resolution:
		Strategies for resolution
	Forward chaining is inefficient and cumbersome
	Backward chaining helps solve forward chaining inefficiencies
		Loads only rules that are part of solving some arbitrary goal
		Looks for primitives that can be evaluated by asking experts true/false
			questions
KB: Contains Rules
	How to deal with uncertainty?
	Need fuzzy logic
		Extend knowledge base to use statistical distributions to 
			evaluate which rules to fire

Uncertainty:
	Lack of exact knowledge of the facts
	Sources:
		weak implications 
		imprecise lanuage
		unknown data
	Approaches: 
		Probability Theory
		Practical Model

Certainty Theory
	Knowledge base contains uncertain rules and information
	Uses certainty factor to determine truth value of premise/conclusion
	Certainty Factor (CF)
		Range -1/+1 (0.1)
		Positive value represents belief
		Negative value represents disbelief
		Combine two rules w/ same conclusion, but have different CF
		Commutative property
			order doesn't matter
		Assymptotic Property
			Probability should not exceed 1
			The combining function should converge toward one

		Net Belief
			Obtain total net belief by combining the 
				measure of belief ("MB")
				with the 
				measure of disbelief ("MD")
			If MB is greater, belief in hypothesis confirmed
			If MD is greater, disbelief in hypothesis is confirmed
