			  T
			  T

The next three questions pertain to the logical statement S: 
     ( ~p  ^  (p v q) ) -> q 
15. Use a truth table to show that S is a tautology.
	( ~p  ^  (p v q) ) -> q

	      F	  	   T  F
	      T		   T  T

16. In English explain why S is a tautology. Hint: explain why the antecedent can never be true when the conseqence q is false. (This is a proof by contradiction.)

	The antecedent can never be true when the consquent is false because this would contradict the entire statement being a tautology.

17. Is this a correct application of logical equivalences to S?

                            == (p v q) v (~p ^ ~q)      Associativity

True, by conditional elimination

18. Explain why (p v q) v (~p ^ ~q) is a tautology. 

	Because when p is true the expression evaluates to true, and when p is false the expression evaluates to true. Expression always evaluates to true.
