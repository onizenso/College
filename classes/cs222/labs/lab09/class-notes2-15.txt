know permissions for classes (i.e. private, public, protected)

know encapsulation defintion -
	the process of hiding primitive data types/variables within a class, 
	thus restricting the user's access to those variables. When 
	encapsulating data, public member functions must be used to access 
	and manipulate data that is declared private or protected.
